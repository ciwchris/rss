              Client Side Decryption on Azure Spring Apps
              <span class="post-metadata">(31 min | 9449 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/client-side-decryption-on-azure-spring-apps/ba-p/3621622>You can use client side decryption of properties on Azure Spring Apps by following the steps below:
Add the encrypted property in your¬†.properties¬†file in your git repository.It would look like:


message&#x3D;{cipher}f43e3df3862ab196a4b367624a7d9b581e1c543610da353fbdd2477d60fb282f


Update the Config Server on Azure Spring App to use the git repository which has our encrypted property. You could do it directly from Azure Portal or use¬†Azure CLI:
az spring-cloud config-server git set -n myspringcloud --uri 

In your Spring Boot application, add the decryption key in the¬†bootstrap.yml¬†file. (You would need to create it if it does not exist)


encrypt:
  key: somerandomkey



[This is the key you would have used in order to encrypt your property earlier]Now, add some code to get the value of the encrypted property.


package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {

    @Value(&quot;${message:default}&quot;) 
    String message;

    @GetMapping(&quot;/&quot;)
    public String hello() {
        return message;
    }

}



Create an App, or deploy to an existing one.
az spring-cloud app create -n 

¬†
Deploy your app.
az spring-cloud app deploy -n appName --jar-path 

¬†
Assign a public endpoint (or use the Test Endpoints)
az spring-cloud app update -n appName --assign-endpoint true

¬†
Access your application to view the value.
https://-.azuremicroservices.io/

¬†
(Optional) You can check the encrypted values on the Config Server by following the steps mentioned in thisdocumentation:¬†https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-access-data-plane-azure-ad-rbac</a>

The start-up File ‚Äì run shell commands and scripts that need to be persistent

1. Using Web SSH
As we have mentioned earlier, web SSH can be used to run commands and scripts that are non-persistent. For example, navigating folders, reading the contents of a file, or echoing a message. Here, we will learn how to echo ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù in web SSH.

working on so many tiny npm modules

But systematic factors aside ‚Äì what you see here is focus.

In a previous post, we introduced the isolated process model, which decouples your function code from the core Azure Functions host, in contrast to the traditional model where we run them together in the same process. Functions V4 supports .NET 6 in both models, and the isolated process model also supports .NET 7 (public preview) and Framework 4.8 (public preview). In this update, we‚Äôll re-cap some of our recent updates, outline some changes to look forward to, and expand on our thinking about future versions.

This year&#x27;s keynote by Mark Little, VP of Engineering at Red Hat, will be on &quot;Transactional Microservices in Kube-native Manner&quot; where he dives into the role it place in distributed computing, which is not necessarily the kind of transaction developers typically use. Quarkus and Eclipse MicroProfile are examples of what this looks like today.
¬†
Special guest speaker, Lasada Pippen is a ground up, self-established engineering and technologist who now inspires people to overcome odds and face difficulties to pursue your dreams. For J4K, he will talk about &quot;Hidden Gems&quot; that you are and how to make cloud companies recognize this. Lasada will help you identify how valuable you are even if you&#x27;re not being immediately recognized, how to navigate through this, and overcome hurdles to harness your success.

Our goal back then was to give developers the flexibility to build, deploy, and scale web apps and APIs on their own terms, regardless of price. Today, we remain just as committed to that goal‚Äîand are doubling down on our commitment to improving and growing the free tier alongside our premium offerings.

Create your keys using the following command on your terminal


ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;test@mymail.com&quot;



This will create a public key (.pub) and a private key.
Copy the public key on GitHub
Go to your GitHub account -&gt; Settings -&gt; SSH and GPG keys Click on¬†New SSH key¬†and copy the public key here.
Configure the Config Server on Azure Spring Apps
Go to the Azure Spring Apps Service -&gt; Config ServerSpecify the GitHub URL, Label etc. and choose SSH as the Authentication protocol. Copy your private key in the text box and save.

(Optional) To ensure that the key works, you can test it on the local system as well.
Refer:¬†Clone GitHub Repository using SSH


eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;

ssh-add 

git clone 
#Example of the URL: git@github.com:username/testconfig.git



You should now have access to your private GitHub Repository via SSH from Azure Spring Apps.</a>

Note that, if you are using a custom image, you could enable webSSH and collect dumps using jcmd, if present.
¬†
1. Go to the Kudu Site of the WebApp via Advanced Tools blade:

2. Click on SSH to ssh into the Application Container:
¬†

3. Get the PID of the Java Process (your application):
[There are multiple ways to get it. We can use ps -ef | grep java¬†| grep -v grep command, or simply run jcmd]
¬†

¬†
4. Finally, execute the following command to collect the Thread Dump and save it as a file.¬†
¬†
jcmd  Thread.print &gt; /home/threaddump
Similarly, to collect the heap dump, run:jcmd  GC.heap_dump /home/heapdump
¬†

¬†
Note:
The files under /home are only persistent by default. Consider collecting the dumps under /home or in the mounted location for External Storage (if using BYOS)</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/09/09/wilderplace.html>There are few people I‚Äôve worked as closely with as Saman Bemel Benrud.
We built a lot of stuff together at Mapbox, from iD
to Mapbox Studio. But he was
insistent that after this job, he was going to make games and comics.
No more tech rocket ships.
He‚Äôs gone and done it. Saman, along with Micah Fitch and Tom Lubanovic, released
Wilderplace today. It‚Äôs an endlessly creative
turn-based adventure game.

It‚Äôs been in the works since 2019, and has all the marks of
a gesamkunstwerk.
Everything is handmade, from the hand-drawn animations to the fonts,
which Saman created from scratch and released on GitHub.

Micah wrote a soundtrack that organically combines motifs as you progress
through the game, and uses the still pretty cutting-edge web audio tech to
emulate synthesizers.


I‚Äôve been lucky to play beta versions of the game, but it‚Äôs progressed
really far in the last year. You can play it with a game controller, it has
this inventory system, it‚Äôs all a pretty impressive technical achievement,
on top of a fun game. And now it‚Äôs released, and you
can buy it on Steam
or check out wilderplace.place.</a>

Introduction to Azure API Management
APIs enable digital experiences, simplify application integration, underpin new digital products, and make data and services reusable and universally accessible. With the proliferation and increasing dependency on APIs, organizations need to manage them as first-class assets throughout their lifecycle. Azure API Management helps customers meet these challenges:

Abstract backend architecture diversity and complexity from API consumers
Securely expose services hosted on and outside of Azure as APIs
Protect, accelerate, and observe APIs

While running a load test in Azure Load Testing you might wonder if you‚Äôve configured the correct number threads (users) in your Apache JMeter script. A thread runs through a transaction from start to finish, and then repeats until the test is over. You may notice that a test runs successfully with a lower number of threads, but the test may fail with errors once you increase the load.

A quick online search of the topic returns a laundry list of articles, e-books, twitter threads, etc. all trying to nail down the one true definition.

Normally, this error message means the TLS handshake has failed to establish, and today I want to share the common reason for that: the NGINX-based AKS package limits certain cipher suites in the connectivity.

Symptom
Connection from the 2012R2 on-prem Windows server to the AKS would fail, with the error message:¬†

Troubleshooting

Capture the network trace, and you will find Encrypted Alert during the TLS handshake:


2. Note that the handshake would fail immediately after the client hello. This means TLS handshake fails to establish, and most often it&#x27;s due to the server and client does not have common cipher suites to exchange.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/09/01/recently.html>This was another exciting, busy, and challenging month. Placemark
clocked in another month of pretty good organic growth, and I spent a week
at Gradient Retreat, which was everything
I hoped it would be - relaxing, intellectually invigorating, a place where
I got to know a bunch of people working on interesting things, and a real
opportunity to focus.
At Placemark, I released a changelog
and a new parser, plus
did a lot of important but quiet changes, like upgrading Blitz
to 2.0 and implementing both map sharing and SAML support using WorkOS.
I guess that part of it was a loop that connected - I built a lot of Placemark‚Äôs components
using Radix, a project whose team now works at WorkOS.

Vancouver was a fascinating place to visit - aesthetically so different than
New York or San Francisco.‚Ä¶</a>

              Long execution functions with Service Bus Trigger
              <span class="post-metadata">(31 min | 9390 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/long-execution-functions-with-service-bus-trigger/ba-p/3613575>Function App under at least a Premium plan could have unlimited execution time. However, it might caused a duplicated invocation issue with a ServiceBus trigger because the &quot;PeekLock&quot; duration is up to 5 minutes (including renew).
¬†
It is a tutorial to reproduce such the scenario.
¬†
STEP 1: In Azure portal, create a new Premium python Function App and a Service Bus + Queue
¬†
STEP 2: Download the sample code and apply some changes.
https://cchlab.blob.core.windows.net/cchlab/cchlabsbf.zip
In &quot;host.json&quot;, please specify the Function App timeout and the ServiceBus PeekLock timeout as below.

In &quot;ServiceBusQueueTrigger1/function.json&quot;, please setup some configuration:
SBQ_STRING&#x3D;

Then, deploy the project to Function App.
¬†
STEP 3: Making an experiment with a short execution time.
Visit:¬†https://.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t&#x3D;
Please specify the &quot;DurationInSecond&quot; to 30 this time, and you may see the result like this:

We apply this operation to send a message to the ServiceBus queue and told the ServiceBus trigger to pause 30 seconds before execution.
Now, please go to the monitor page:

You can see it is just a normal short invocation.
¬†
STEP 4: Making an experiment with a long execution time.
Visit:¬†https://.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t&#x3D;
Please specify the &quot;DurationInSecond&quot; to 330 this time, and you may see the result like this:

Now, please go to the monitor page:

As you can see, there are duplicate invocations with the same message id, which might caused some potential business issues if we ignore them.
¬†
Conclusion:
Since we cannot adjust &quot;maxAutoRenewDuration&quot; to more than 5 minutes, we could only reduce the execution time from this ServiceBus trigger.</a>

One of the obvious benefits of open, cloud-based technologies is the ability to integrate a wide range of global services with on-premises resources. If you‚Äôve developed for financial services for any length of time, you know this openness adds another level of complexity to development. When money movement is involved, you‚Äôre going to encounter a higher level of risk and compliance considerations.
This blog highlights just such an issue encountered by the DevStudio engineering team here at Fiserv, and how we solved it. I hope this blog helps you understand not only how our team works but gives you useful context for implementing your own solutions that prioritize security and compliance without sacrificing speed or functionality.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220509171056.htm>Researchers describe a novel form of gene regulation that is altered in bladder cancer, leading to the boosting of a gene pathway that helps the cancer cells survive during rapid growth. The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220509100931.htm>Young adults who were at risk of food insecurity had increased incidence of diabetes 10 years later, according to a new study. While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they&#x27;d been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.</a>

Now scientists have shown that the same may be true for cells, uncovering a newly-discovered mechanism that might help prevent the build-up of tangles of proteins commonly seen in dementia. Scientists have identified a new mechanism that appears to reverse the build-up of aggregates, not by eliminating them completely, but rather by &#x27;refolding&#x27; them.</a>

The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population&#x27;s increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220504082622.htm>In the search for eternal youth, fecal transplants may seem like an unlikely way to reverse the aging process. However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.</a>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

Three slices of bread or one teaspoon of table salt will do it, and chances are your daily sodium intake is far greater. More than 90% of Americans consume too much sodium, which can lead to hypertension, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. A new article provides a comprehensive review of scientific literature on sodium reduction strategies in food production.</a>
