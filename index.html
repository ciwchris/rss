It finally came to the new protocol HTTP/2 announced by IETF in 2015, which is a more modernized, faster and more secure version, almost all major web browsers are on board so far.
As one of the powerful app platform providers, App service team also announced the support for the HTTP/2 protocol  for all apps hosted on App Service in March 2018.
 
What are the key differences from HTTP/1.x on app service?
 

HTTP/2 is binary

The good news is that you don’t need to go full-on cloud native all at once. Azure App Service offers a comprehensive platform for hosting .NET applications in the cloud with minimal code changes needed to the existing web app.
In this article I want to talk about how Azure App Service makes an excellent first step for a .NET application’s cloud journey. By the end of this article, I want you to have enough information to have a foundation for taking your taking your app to the cloud – and honestly to decide whether it’s the right decision at all.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/storing-app-service-application-logs-in-blob/ba-p/3800963>Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service web app. The primary aim of this blog is to guide one step-by-step to add instrumentation to your application, as well as how to access the information logged.
 
Step 1:
Go to &gt;App Service Logs&gt; Enable Application Logging (Blob) and select the desired Blob Storage and the Container and select the Level of logging.
 

 
For more information on different types of logs you can refer this document.
 
Step 2:
Below is the code we have deployed a .Net Core MVC web application in a Windows App Service.
 
 
 public IActionResult Index()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation(&quot;This is a test to send logs to : Blob &quot;);

            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }
 
 
Below are different level of logs details which you can log:
 

 




Note: If you write logs to blobs, the retention policy no longer applies if you delete the app but keep the logs in the blobs. For more information, see Costs that might accrue after resource deletion.




 
Step 3:
Go to Storage Account&gt; Container and select the folder with your app service name and download the ( .txt ) file to check the logs.
 

 
The Blob option also includes additional information in the log messages, such as the ID of the origin VM instance of the log message (InstanceId), thread ID (Tid), and a more granular timestamp (EventTickCount) in a ( .csv ) file.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice. Or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…</a>

Today we are excited to announce the introduction of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Long Term Support (LTS).
 
We’re hearing from customers across a variety of organizations, from healthcare to manufacturing and beyond, who need a longer window of stability.  We’ve heard from ISVs that having to be on a constant treadmill to keep their environments in sync with community releases adds a significant burden to delivering value to their customers.

Azure Resource Graph is an Azure service designed to extend Azure Resource Management by providing efficient and performant resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across a given set of subscriptions so that you can effectively govern your environment.
These queries provide the following abilities:

Query resources with complex filtering, grouping, and sorting by resource properties.
Explore resources iteratively based on governance requirements.
Assess the impact of applying policies in a vast cloud environment.
Query changes made to resource properties (preview).

Below are few resource types supported by Azure Resource Graph:

              General Availability for Azure Active Directory (AD) Workload Identity on AKS

It is the next evolution of a public preview feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), that is built on the now deprecated pod identity project. Azure AD Workload Identity, is simpler to use and replaces pod identity. Azure AD Workload Identity on AKS is now generally available so customers can run production workloads using Workload Identity on both Windows and Linux and migrate applications using Pod Identity over to Workload Identity. 
 
Azure AD Workload Identity leverages Service Account Token Volume Projection giving pods the ability to use a Kubernetes identity (service account), to which a Kubernetes token is issued and OIDC federation which enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory based on annotated service accounts.
 
Since the open-source pod identity project is now deprecated, AKS will continue to support the AKS pod identity through 2023. To ease the transition, customers can run Pod Identity and Workload Identity in parallel on an existing AKS cluster.  Please note that during the Public Preview we enabled the sidecar to give customers time to update their SDKs, but this is not a supported configuration for General Availability. We recommend that customers update applications to a list of supported SDKs that will allow applications to talk to the AAD endpoint.</a>

With workloads configured to consume only the necessary resources and dynamically scale to meet demand, businesses can optimize resource usage while reducing downtime. Additionally, Kubernetes allows organizations to deploy multiple applications from various teams or business units to a single cluster, resulting in significantly reduced infrastructure costs. However, this multitenancy approach poses a new challenge.
 
Consider this scenario: your cluster generates $100/day in infrastructure spend with a shared set of resources split across 10 developer teams. If 1 team consumes 80% of the cluster’s resources, it does not make sense to split infrastructure costs evenly across all teams at $10/day. Instead, your organ…</a>

              Enabling AppServiceAppLogs &amp; AppServiceHTTPLogs diagnostic settings in app services

This blog will guide you step-by-step to enable AppServiceHTTPLogs , AppServiceAppLogs and view them in Log Analytics.
 
Step 1:
Go to Azure Portal &gt; App Service &gt; Diagnostic Settings and enable the required settings you would like to send to the destination . In this blog I have taken an example of HTTP Logs and App Service Application Logs in a Windows App Service ( .Net Core ).
 

 
You can refer this doc for more details on supported log types.
 
Step 2:
In your application code you can use the usual logging options and send log messages to application logs. By default, ASP.NET Core uses the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices logging provider. For more information, see ASP.NET Core logging in Azure.
 
Below is the code snippet of the logging I am doing in my .Net Core MVC webapp.
 

 
 
Step 3:
Go to Azure Portal &gt; Log Analytics workspace &gt; Logs and query the AppServiceAppLogs table and you can see the logs being sent. You can use different levels of logging such as Error, Information, Verbose and etc. in your application and this will show up in your logs in Log Analytics under the “Level” field. You can filter out logs based on the level:
 

 
Similarly, you can also query AppServiceHTTPLogs:
 

 
Sample Queries in Log Analytics:
 




AppServiceAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated &gt;ago(10m)
 
AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where TimeGenerated &gt;ago(10m)




 
 
More information:

AppServiceAppLogs is now available for ASP .NET apps on Windows - Azure App Service

Therefore, they usually enable private endpoint as well as configure Access Restriction to deny all the public traffic.
 
When the private endpoint is enabled and public traffic is denied to the web app, all the public traffic to this app is cut off. Since there is a range of IP addresses where agents are deployed, they have a public IP. Obviously, these agents are unable to reach web app.

 
As a solution, we can either allow the IP ranges list in the firewall or use self-hosted agents to deploy.

When a web app acts as a client and makes an HTTPS call to an external server secured by a private CA, the web app uses its default installed trusted root CA’s public key to validate the server’s certificate. However, the remote server certificate is signed by a private CA, and since there is no such trusted CA in the web app’s trusted source list, it will not be validated by the web app. You cannot modify th…</a>

In this blog post, we will discuss how to troubleshoot failed external calls between App Services using the App Service IP Sec audit logs.
 
App Service IP Sec audit logs provide detailed information about the traffic that passes through your IPsec tunnel. This information can be used to troubleshoot issues related to failed external calls between App Services. The audit logs provide details such as source IP address, destination IP address, protocol, and port number.

Having the ability to scale your infrastructure up and down instantly is just one of the many benefits associated with serverless apps. In this article, we are going write the function as a service (FaaS) — i.e., a serverless function that will interact with data via a database, to produce meaningful results. FaaS can also be very useful in A/B testing when you want to quickly release an independent function without going into actual implementation or release. In this article, you&#x27;ll learn how to use MongoDB Atlas, a cloud database, when you&#x27;re getting started with Azure functions in Java.

This structure is designed to adapt compute options to individual apps and microservices components for more flexible microservices solutions. Azure Container Apps now supports a Dedicated plan in addition to the existing serverless Consumption plan.
 
The Dedicated plan guarantees single tenancy and specialized compute options including memory-optimized choices. In addition, the new Dedicated plan runs in the same Azure Container Apps environment as the serverless Consumption plan. This allows apps or microservice components that may have different resource requirements depending on component purpose or development stack to run in the same Azure Container Apps environment.  An…</a>

If you haven’t started yet, you can get started and run your first load test in less than 10 minutes.
 
Azure Load Testing (ALT) provides a unified dashboard of test statistics, client-side metrics, and server-side metrics so that the performance bottlenecks can be easily identified. While the out of the box dashboard is helpful in most scenarios, you might want the load test results to be available in a tool of your choice –

You have a dashboard to monitor multiple aspects of service reliability and you want to see load test results in that dashboard.

What is WordPress Multisite?
 
WordPress Multisite is a feature of WordPress that enables you to run and manage multiple WordPress websites using the same WordPress installation. You could update multiple websites in a single click by using the parent WordPress dashboard, and even manage individual sites through their individual dashboards. This feature was previously called WordPress Multi-User.
 
For example, a multinational e-commerce store can create multiple country-specific subsites in the same WordPress installation using this feature. The root admin can install plugins and themes required for all the websites at once. They can also assign different admins to each subsite. A lot of our customers use the multisite feature for various scenar…</a>

However, the module worked fine on my local environment, single virtual machine, or single-instance app service.
 
This behavior occurs because Node-Cache and other private cache solutions are designed to store data in the memory of a single process. The private cache works properly when running on a single instance, as all requests are handled by the same process and have access to the same cache.
 

However, in a multi-instance environment like a multi-instance App Service, using a private cache can lead to inconsistent behavior and data inconsistency.
 
For example, you save a value in one cache in an instance. Then, a request tries to read th…</a>

For example, you might want to enable a custom authentication process, create a sampler of your own, or design a testing element that is not yet released in the open source JMeter community. 
Custom plugins extend the core functionality of JMeter and may allow you to implement that custom scenario into your performance tests to fine tune your test scripts and reporting capabilities. Learn how to get more from your performance testing, using custom plugins and Azure Load Testing.
