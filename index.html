              <a target="_blank" href=https://kagifeedback.org/d/4716-sept-4th-2024-announcing-the-assistant/1>The Assistant is here!
Today we‚Äôre excited to unveil the Assistant, a new powerful tool for information consumption that complements Kagi Search. Assistant features direct access to world&#x27;s best LLMs, grounded in Kagi Search, all in one place and for one price.
Read all about it in Announcing the Assistant blog post.
This update replaces the Beta version introduced nearly a year ago. It includes many new features, and we are working hard to bring back a few missing ones from the Beta, notably file upload, as soon as possible. You can still access the &quot;old&quot; assistant during the transition period using this link.
We also want to take this opportunity to extend a big thank you to our community, especially to our distinguished members and contributors, for all the feedback and testing that helped us create a better product.
Growing the Kagi community
We recently expanded our social presence on the wider web to include Mastodon, Blue Sky and Threads, so be sure to engage with us and follow our journey from the platforms of your choice!

However, without understanding the dependencies between Azure resources (e.g., Function App depends on Storage Account), it is difficult to customize the templates.

What is managed identity?

It&#x27;s a feature in Azure that allows applications to authenticate to cloud services securely without needing to manage credentials like API keys. 

Managed identity in Azure works by providing an *automatically managed identity* for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authent‚Ä¶</a>

              How to disable SAS token on consumption/Premium plan hosted function apps
              <span class="post-metadata">(29 min | 8789 words)</span>

This means that even if we can use identity-based host connections to replace the AzureWebjobsStorage, which uses a SAS token, we still cannot remove the file share connection strings (WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING) that also rely on a SAS token. Therefore, we are unable to disable the SAS token in the storage account.
¬†
For now, when creating function apps in the consumption/EP plan, we have the option to create an app without Azure File. In this scenario, we can bypass the SAS token requirement for Azure Files and solely utilize managed identity to access the storage account.

To run your app without relying on Azure file share, you need to fulfill the following requirements:

Now, let&#x27;s slightly move the focus to Azure Functions app. How can you containerise the Azure Functions app? Fortunately, Azure Functions Core Tools natively support it with Dockerfile. But is the Dockerfile the only option for containerising your .NET-based Azure Functions apps? Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how Azure Functions apps can be containerised both with and without Dockerfile.

You can find a sample code from this GitHub repository.

Prerequisites

There are a few prerequisites to containerise .NET-based function apps effectively.

.NET SDK 8.0+
Azure Functions Core Tools
Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code + C# Dev Kit + Azure Functions
Docker Desktop

We are excited to announce two significant enhancements to ARO&#x27;s capabilities:

The ability to configure multiple IP addresses per cluster load balancer is now generally available.
ARO clusters can now scale up to 250 worker nodes.

Previously, ARO clusters were limited to 62 worker nodes due to having only one IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with the cluster&#x27;s load balancer. By enabling multiple IP addresses for the load balancer, we have removed this bottleneck, offering organizations greater flexibility in expanding their deployments.

Azure Web App (App Service) exposes ports 80/443, with 443 being the encrypted port commonly used. This means that regardless of which port your locally developed application listens to, you need to perform port forwarding when deploying to the Web App.

WebJobs are a feature of Azure App Service that allows you to run background tasks or scripts in your App Service. They are particularly useful for executing jobs such as scheduled tasks, data processing, or background maintenance tasks. WebJobs can run continuously, on-demand, or on a scheduled basis, and they can be written in various programming languages.
The goal of this blog post is to guide you through the process of setting up and deploying a WebJob on an Azure App Service running Linux. We will walk you through the necessary steps to create and deploy a WebJob, configure its settings, and manage it effectively. By the end of this blog, you will have a working WebJob integrated into your Azure App Service, capable of performing background tasks or processing jobs as ne‚Ä¶</a>

For the workload profile container app, private link support is not yet available. This is because the ‚ÄúPrivate Link Service does not support a load balancer that has an IP-based backend pool, which is used in Consumption + Dedicated environments (Workload Profile)‚Äù. Although we have a roadmap to implement this feature (Private link support for Workload Profiles ¬∑ Azure Container Apps Roadmap), there is currently no ETA.
¬†
In the meantime, I will guide you on how to integrate a workload profile container app with Azure Front Door using an Application Gateway. The architecture involves using the Application Gateway private link to connect to the Front Door, and placing the Application Gateway in the same VNET as the container app to achieve this integration.

You want enterprise-grade security but don&#x27;t know where to start. You&#x27;ve heard terms like Entra ID and Managed identity or maybe even Service principal but where do you go from here? Let&#x27;s start here with this series on security.



35% of all exposed API keys are still active - 35% of exposed API keys still active, posing major security risks - Help Net Security


That&#x27;s a pretty scary statement, that means services are being misused most likely, data is actively being stolen and so on. 

Let&#x27;s try to understand why the concept of API keys is a problematic one and how we can move away from it.

This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won&#x27;t know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.
¬†
In this post, we&#x27;ll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We&#x27;ll create a simple API that implements the¬†Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job. This approach provides a much more robust and scalable solution for long-running tasks.

¬†
Steps:

Create an App registration in Microsoft Entra.


¬†
¬†
¬†

After creation, note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID, which will be used later.


¬†
¬†

Create a Linux web app in Azure Portal and use Node.js.


¬†
¬†

After creation, note down the App Name, which will be used later.


¬†
¬†
¬†

Download the sample code in your development environment:

¬†
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-docs-code-javascript.git
¬†
¬†
¬†

You can use VS Code to open the react-spa subfolder.

¬†
¬†
¬†

Edit src/authConfig.js and make the corresponding modifications:




clientId
Specify the Application (client) ID obtained in step 2


authority
Fill in the Directory (tenant) ID obtained in step 2 in the specified format. (https://login.microsoftonline.com/)


redirectUri
Fill in the App Name obtained in step 4 in the specified format. (https://.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback)




¬†
¬†
¬†

Run the following command to install the relevant packages:

¬†
npm install
¬†
¬†

Run the following command to compile the project. After execution, a build subfolder will be created.

¬†
npm run build
¬†
¬†

Create or modify build/.deployment with the following content:

¬†
[config]
SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT&#x3D;false
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†

Publish your project, specifying the build subfolder during the publishing process.




¬†
¬†

After publishing, go back to the App registration in Microsoft Entra, find Authentication, create a Platform, specify Single-Page Application, and fill in the value of authority from Step 7.


¬†
¬†
¬†

Go back to the project, navigate to Configuration, and specify the Startup Command as follows:

¬†
pm2 serve /home/site/wwwroot --no-daemon --spa
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†

After restarting the web app, you can visit your webpage using a browser.
