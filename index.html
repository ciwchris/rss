Chewing is also known to help prevent obesity, possibly by increasing the thermic effect of food consumption. But the factors behind this heat-generating effect of chewing remain less explored. A new study has revealed that oral stimuli, which are linked with the duration of tasting liquid food in the mouth, and the duration of chewing, play a positive role in increasing energy expenditure after food intake.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/01/220112105630.htm>Long before the onset of dementia, there is evidence for increased activity of the brain&#x27;s immune system. Researchers from DZNE and the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) come to this conclusion based on a study of more than 1,000 older adults. To this end, various proteins were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid: They served as so-called biomarkers that indicate inflammatory processes of the nervous system. As it turned out, some of these molecules seem to be part of a damage control program of the immune system, which could be useful for the development of new drugs.</a>

              A semblance of understanding
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 334 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/01/10/semblance-of-understanding.html>Six years later, I‚Äôm still taking a lot of notes in notebooks. I‚Äôve bought many editions of Field Notes, which I still love. And emptied many Muji pens on the page.
But I have to admit: I‚Äôve only reopened my archived notebooks a handful of times. Once or twice to retrieve contemporaneous notes about business events, and a few times to refresh my memory of the early part of a book while writing a review. So what are notes for?
Part of the Field Notes motto is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not writing it down to remember it later, I‚Äôm writing it down to remember it now.‚Äù That captures part of it, but memory isn‚Äôt the only lens to think about note-taking.
A common thread here is semblance. Note-taking is about building a semblance of understanding, in the same way that exercise can be about creating a semblance of control.

I‚Äôve dissed ‚Äúknowledge graphs‚Äù ad-nauseum ‚Äì¬†that by virtue of never labeling the edges they never capture real relationship between items and make vague thinking easy, that none of their implementers roll up their sleeves and implement better graph layout so they‚Äôre readable and instead use d3‚Äôs force directed graph or graphviz, that they just never really become useful.
But whatever: is it really about using the graph, or is it about looking at it?
You can feel like you understand something without knowing anything about it, and you can understand something without feeling like you do. Both are problematic. Creating notes and other symbols of knowledge is a way to affect that balance.
Maybe the real metacognition isn‚Äôt about having a mirror image of your brain encoded in a computer, but just having a mirror. Having a nice birch box filled with notebooks or a nice dense graph that symbolizes all the things you‚Äôve noted, so that you can learn and forget comfortably. The world will always be too big to understand, but my box of notebooks, that I know.</a>

Researchers looked at whether interventions such as aerobic and strength or resistance training, had helped participants with asthma. Although they found that these interventions worked, patients with asthma may have had difficulty undertaking them because of their difficulty traveling to fitness groups or because the interventions were not suitable for people with additional health conditions. But the team say that digital interventions -- such as video appointments, smartwatches and mobile apps -- could remove some of these barriers and enable patients to carry out home-based programs in future.</a>

Considering the distributed nature of microservices, you need to account for failures, retries, and timeouts in a system composed of microservices. While Container Apps features the building blocks for running microservices, use of Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) provides an even richer microservices programming model.

Azure Container Apps offers a fully managed version of the Dapr APIs when building microservices. When you use Dapr in Azure Container Apps, you can enable sidecars to run next to your microservices that provide a rich set of capabilities.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/01/02/recently.html>I wrote a little yearly round-up over on Placemark.
I‚Äôm not one for concrete resolutions or nostalgia, so on with the usual, a Recently.
Reading
I read Policing the Open Road
on Rebecca‚Äôs suggestion. It‚Äôs an incredible book that I‚Äôll
probably re-read soon, because the central conflict that it sets out feels so thoroughly
deadlocked, unresolvable, and important - the interplay between privacy, safety, police
power, and freedom.
I don‚Äôt agree with all of it, but Jon McLoone‚Äôs explanatio of why Wolfram is not open source
resonated strongly with me. Placemark, as I‚Äôve said before, is not planning on being
open source, though components of the application will be released. Some of my reasoning
lines up with Wolfram‚Äôs pretty precisely. The central piece for me, I think, is just
what the community means - where communities come from, how they agree on what they
do, how they collect and disperse. Magical thinking around what constitutes
community and how it operates is my biggest gripe about open source ideology in this
day and age: too many people happily ignore the top-heaviness of some communities,
or don‚Äôt think about where the direction, leadership, contributions, and standards
come from.
Watching

Watch Vampire‚Äôs Kiss. That is all.
Expect to see in the new year: more, probably shorter, blog posts. More photos.
And Placemark, out in the wild.</a>

It might also be possible to have heard of or currently use oh-my-posh for your PowerShell. Azure offers Azure Cloud Shell service, which uses both Bash Shell and PowerShell by default. Therefore, if you want either oh-my-zsh or oh-my-posh, or both, you should configure it by yourself.
¬†
Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to show how to configure your shell environment for both.
¬†

This GitHub repository provides the working shell script source for your reference.

For oh-my-zsh
¬†
Let&#x27;s configure oh-my-zsh on your Azure Cloud Shell. Make sure that you see the Bash Shell prompt. If not, enter the bash command to switch your prompt to Bash.

Install oh-my-zsh.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/12/211217172730.htm>As our brains age, small lesions begin to pop up in the bundles of white matter that carry messages between our neurons. The lesions can damage this white matter and lead to cognitive deficits. Now, researchers not only provide an explanation for the location of these lesions but also how they develop in the first place.</a>

Using data from more than 15,300 patients in the US, researchers found that a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning can accurately tell who will go on to develop dementia.</a>

However, a large new study does not show a relationship between high intake of gluten and increased IBS symptoms. The researchers did find that a certain type of carbohydrate called &#x27;fodmaps&#x27; can aggravate intestinal problems, however, the overall results indicate that they also have less influence than previously thought.</a>
