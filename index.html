Researchers discovered mice who ate high-fat diets produced less of these tags on their intestinal cells, suppressing the ability of immune cells to identify and eliminate intestinal tumors. The high-fat diet also reduced the presence of certain bacteria in the mice&#x27;s gut, which normally helps maintain the production of these tags.</a>

Higher intakes of dairy fat were not associated with an increased risk of death.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210921125146.htm>Researchers have uncovered a molecular mechanism behind why obesity can lead to hair thinning. They found that stem cells within hair follicles in mice given a high-fat diet behaved differently from those in mice with a standard diet. Inflammatory signals in the stem cells led to these differences, ultimately resulting in hair thinning and loss. These fascinating data shed light on the complicated link between obesity and organ dysfunction.</a>

But according to a new article, when it comes to getting healthy and reducing mortality risk, increasing physical activity and improving fitness appear to be superior to weight loss. The authors say that employing a weight-neutral approach to the treatment of obesity-related health conditions also reduces the health risks associated with yo-yo dieting.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210909141310.htm>About 300,000 to 400,000 fetuses per year from mothers with diabetes develop neural tube defects -- when the tissue that eventually forms the brain and spinal cord fails to form properly -- which can lead to miscarriage or profound disability. Now using studies in mice, researchers have identified the mechanism behind these structural birth defects, which they say is due to the neural tissue aging prematurely, halting its growth before it has made enough cells to finish forming the neural tube.</a>
