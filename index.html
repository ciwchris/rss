                    <span>Despite lower exercise volume, HIIT was as effective as endurance running for improving exercise capacity and spatial memory. Researchers found that activity-specific physiological adaptations in the muscles and increased signaling and neurogenesis in the hippocampus underlie these improvements. Findings also suggested that benefits can potentially be optimized by tailoring exercise time and intensity.</span>

The research homes in on a particular protein known as Rbbp7, whose dysregulation appears linked to the eventual formation of tau protein tangles and the rampant cell death associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s and other neurodegenerative diseases.</span>

                    <span>Having high blood pressure, high cholesterol and/or obesity from childhood through middle age were linked to poorer brain function by middle age. These cardiovascular risk factors were linked with low memory, learning, visual processing, attention span, and reaction and movement time. Strategies to prevent heart disease and stroke should begin in childhood to promote better brain health by middle age.</span>

The findings suggest that heavy consumption of sugary drinks during adolescence (ages 13 to 18) and adulthood can increase the disease risk.</span>

                    <span>Over the years, physicians and historians have attributed Shackleton&#x27;s failing health during his Antarctic expeditions to scurvy or a congenital heart defect. By studying other explorers and learning they had symptoms comparable to those of Shackleton, researchers concluded that beriberi provided a sound scientific and medical explanation for the famed explorer&#x27;s health struggles.</span>

                    <span>Researchers have identified a set of genes, called clock genes, that control circadian rhythms. But a more complicated gene network than previously known appears related to these rhythms. Scientists detail a statistical model they are using to help identify the genes involved in this network. With help from other disciplines, they hope to fully understand how these genes work together to make different people more productive at different times of day.</span>

San Francisco is a dream to run in. You have hills like Twin Peaks that tower over the city, rugged places like Glen Canyon where you can forget you’re in a city. Running around the Embarcadero in the heat, and running to the ocean via Golden Gate Park, where that last leg of JFK Drive gets chilly because of the sea breeze. Eleva…</span>

                    <span>Researchers examined a subset of GABA neurons in the circadian rhythm control center within the hypothalamus of the brain. They eliminated GABA signaling of vasopressin-producing neurons only in mice and found that it impaired circadian behavior. Specifically, time spent being active increased every day. Analysis showed a timing mismatch between the center&#x27;s molecular clock and the behavior. Thus, GABA signaling is required to make sure the timing remains in sync.</span>

                    <span>Despite the prevalence of Alzheimer&#x27;s, there are still no treatments, in part because it has been challenging to study how the disease develops. Now, scientists have uncovered new insights into what goes awry during Alzheimer&#x27;s by growing neurons that resemble -- more accurately than ever before -- brain cells in older patients. And like patients themselves, the afflicted neurons appear to lose their cellular identity.</span>

                    <span>Research on how obesity impacts the diagnosis, management and outcomes of heart and blood vessel disease, heart failure and arrhythmias is summarized in a new statement. Waist circumference, an indicator of abdominal obesity, should be regularly measured as it is a potential warning sign of increased cardiovascular disease risk. Interventions that lead to weight loss improve risk factors yet may not always lead to improvement in coronary artery disease outcomes.</span>
