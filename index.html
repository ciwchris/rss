                <p>An individual human can maintain stable social relationships with about 150 people, not more. This is the proposition known as 'Dunbar's number' - that the architecture of the human brain sets an upper limit on our social lives. A new study indicates that a cognitive limit on human group sizes cannot be derived in this manner.</p>

                <p>Age may influence an a human egg cell's ability to process gene products essential for the last steps of its development. The final maturation stage is critical for reproduction because it provides the material early embryos need to develop normally and survive. The researchers also found that abnormal BMI also impacted oocyte development, but through different root mechanisms compared to the fertility decline caused by age.</p>

                <p>Despite the prevalence of Alzheimer's, there are still no treatments, in part because it has been challenging to study how the disease develops. Now, scientists have uncovered new insights into what goes awry during Alzheimer's by growing neurons that resemble -- more accurately than ever before -- brain cells in older patients. And like patients themselves, the afflicted neurons appear to lose their cellular identity.</p>

                <p>A simple dietary supplement reduces behavioral symptoms in mice with a genetic mutation that causes schizophrenia. After additional experiments, including visualizing the fluorescently stained dancing edge of immature brain cells, researchers concluded that the supplement likely protects proteins that build neurons' cellular skeletons.</p>

                <p>A dementia diagnosis turns the world upside down, not only for the person affected but also for their relatives, as brain function gradually declines. Those affected lose their ability to plan, remember things or behave appropriately. At the same time, their motor skills also deteriorate. Ultimately, dementia patients are no longer able to handle daily life alone and need comprehensive care. New research shows that cognitive motor training helps in the fight against Alzheimer's and dementia.</p>

                <p>Eight months after mild COVID-19, one in ten people still has at least one moderate to severe symptom that is perceived as having a negative impact on their work, social or home life, according to a new study. The most common long-term symptoms are a loss of smell and taste and fatigue.</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>On the surface, Parkinson's disease and melanoma do not appear to have much in common. However, for nearly 50 years, doctors have recognized that Parkinson's disease patients are more likely to develop melanoma than the general population. Now, scientists report a molecular link between the two diseases in the form of protein aggregates known as amyloids.</p>

                <p>A new study in mice describes novel neurocircuitry between midbrain structures that control feeding behaviors that are under modulatory control by leptin, a hormone made by body fat. Since the discovery of leptin in the 1990s, researchers have wondered how leptin can suppress appetite.</p>
