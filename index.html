We have been conducting user study with Socket.IO users for the past few months and had to chance to meet the core maintainer of the open-source project. We were pleasantly surprised by the variety of applications built using Socket.IO, from identity management to robotics, not just chat apps. 
 
Scaling out Socket.IO apps can be frustrating for developers.
Overwhelmingly, users reported their love of the “intuitive APIs” and how easy it is to get productive with the library once they get over the initial learning curve. However, scaling out a Socket.IO app is where the most frustration and difficulty lie. Developers would much rather focus on building real-time experiences than developing and maintaining an “adapter” component like Red…</a>

              How to remove the PHP X-Powered-By header from HTTP response for PHP 8.x apps on Linux App Service
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9891 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-remove-the-php-x-powered-by-header-from-http-response-for/ba-p/3905880>We can follow the below steps to remove the PHP X-Powered-By header from HTTP response for PHP 8.x apps on Linux App Service –
By default, PHP version is getting displayed as in the below screenshot-

 
 Updating PHP Settings-

Go to your KUDU site https://.scm.azurewebsites.net.
Select Bash or SSH from the top menu.
In Bash/SSH, go to your &quot;/home/site&quot; directory.
Create a directory called &quot;ini&quot; (i.e. mkdir ini)
Change directories to &quot;ini&quot;.
We&#x27;ll need to create an &quot;ini&quot; file to add our settings to.  In this example, I&#x27;m using &quot;settings.ini&quot;.  There are no file editors such as Vi, Vim, or Nano so we&#x27;ll simply use echo to add the settings to the file.  I&#x27;m changing the expose_php setting to Off.  Below is the command that I used to add the setting and create an &quot;settings.ini&quot; file if one doesn&#x27;t already exist.

 NOTE:  If you already have an extensions.ini file, you can use the same command which will add the new setting to the file. 
/home/site/ini&gt;echo &quot; expose_php &#x3D; Off &quot; &gt;&gt; settings.ini
If using SSH, you can use vi to create/edit the settings file using the following commands.

 vi settings.ini
 Press &quot;i&quot; on your keyboard to start editing and add the following.

 expose_php &#x3D; Off  
3. Press &quot;Esc&quot;, then &quot;:wq!&quot; and enter to save.
Add an Application Setting-
We&#x27;ll now need to go to the Azure Portal and add an Application Setting to scan the &quot;ini&quot; directory
              1) Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and select your App Service Linux PHP application.
              2) Select Application Settings for the app.
              3) Under the Application settings section, press the &quot;+ Add new setting&quot;.
              4) For the App Setting Name, enter &quot;PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR&quot;. For the value, enter &quot;/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini&quot;
 
Testing – 
Go to kudu site and run the command below and you can verify that PHP header is removed.

Recently, I have touched on a case when the customer would like to interact with Azure PowerShell Function to work with Storage Account and SFTP server. There are some advantages why customers would like to apply for this solution:

PowerShell allows IT admins to apply system-level integration with other components more easily.
Azure Functions provide the convenience of URI/timer-triggered maintenance tasks.

Demand Analysis
We will first start with the demand analysis. The task will be divided into the following sections:

Pull the required file contents from Azure Storage Account, and store them inside Azure Function App.
Upload files to another VM via SFTP.
To work with Azure resources, we also need to apply proper authentication to enhance security.

This guide is to help you troubleshoot Azure SQL connectivity and authentication issues on Linux App Services.
Note: At the time of writing this cannot be executed in Linux Function Apps, since we don&#x27;t have access to the environmental variables needed to run the commands. 
On Windows App Services you can performance such connectivity and authentication troubleshooting by running MSI Validator, but on Linux App Services we need to leverage the WebSSH functionality to troubleshoot.
So, to address below you can find a list of commands to test connectivity and access to Azure SQL Server Database on Linux App Services. 
Connectivity troubleshooting steps
We would need to follow the 4 steps mentioned below to test the connectivity:

In case of a disconnection, you might run into common errors such as &quot;Azure Functions runtime is unreachable&quot;. Fortunately, Microsoft has a helpful guide to address this issue, which provides self-help troubleshooting steps for recovering your storage account in case of such errors. You can check it out here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-recover-storage-account.
 
Previously, the only way to grant the permission for an Azure Function to access its runtime in a storage account was via the connection string in &quot;azurewebjobsstorage&quot; configuration. However, a new and more secure approach exists for grant…</a>

It’s been another busy year and I’m as aware as ever of the challenge of keeping all of my habits and outputs going. Some, like reading, are easy to maintain, but others, like writing, long-term projects, recording music, require focus and dedicated time that can be hard to track down. But I’ll keep fighting to keep these habits alive, always wary of prioritizing the mundane and waking up five years later having produced nothing really that useful.

It offers many awesome features, and APIM Policies is one of the ones. For example, You can use the APIM policies to extends the APIM features or configure security policies to protect your backend APIs. While you need to write the policy documents in the XML format, it has a fairly bit amount of learning curves – it&#x27;s not that easy to use.
 
Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how GitHub Copilot helps us write the APIM policy documents, with a few technical scenarios.

In the last article about WP Multisite: How to setup Subdirectory Multisite in WordPress on Azure App Service - Microsoft Community Hub, we discussed about what WordPress multisite is and how we can set up multisite in WordPress on App Service using the sub directory style. In this article, we will learn about how we can set up subdomain style multisite.
WordPress Multisite – quick recap
WordPress Multisite is a feature of WordPress that enables you to run, manage and administer multiple WordPress websites from a single WordPress installation. You could update multiple websites in a single click by using the parent WordPress dashboard, and even manage individual sites through their individual dashboards. This feature was previously called WordPress Mu…</a>

Once you set up a new WordPress website on App Service, you can access your website using the URL .azurewebsites.net. Custom Domains are domain names that reflect your brand or company. For example, microsoft.com is the custom domain used by Microsoft for their website. In this article, we will learn about how we can use Custom Domains and subdomains with our WordPress website on App Service.
 
You can buy an App Service domain and use it with your WordPress website. App Service Domains are custom domains that are managed directly in Azure. Also, if you have an existing custom domain registered with any other registrar, you can use that with your WordPress website as well. We will also learn how we can add subdomains if we have a custom doma…</a>

A cipher suite is a set of instructions that contains algorithms and protocols to help secure network connections between clients and servers. By default, the front-end’s OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.
App Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.
