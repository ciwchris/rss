              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/storage-explorer-1-28-new-features/ba-p/3761787>We are excited to announce the release of Storage Explorer 1.28.0 that will help enhance our developer’s experience while accessing a variety of storage services!
 
Storage Explorer 1.28.0:
 
Storage Explorer strives to make it easy for developers to quickly access and manage many storage services under different accounts. After analyzing customer research and telemetry, version 1.28.0 will include new updates/features that will benefit our developers’ journey.
 
To highlight a few features, the Storage Explorer 1.28.0 now allows for Text preview enhancements and downloading multiple blobs at once when filtering based on a tag:
 

 
 

Text Preview Enhancements

Additional content-types have been added to the built in list of content-types which can be text previewed. These include: - text/xml - application/xml - application/json
You can now preview files of any size, but only the first 10MB of the file. You can download the file and open it in your default text editor to view the entire file. A status bar will appear at the top of the preview tab that informs you of files greater than 10MB


Multi Blob Download When Filtering by Tags

When filtering by tags, you can now download multiple blobs at once by clicking the Download in either the context menu or toolbar of the blob



 
Other features in this update include:

SAS Expiration Warnings
Trust File Extension During Open
Copy Between Blob Containers and File Shares
Filter by Prefix in ADLS Gen2 Blob Containers
Sub-Directory Prefix Search in File Shares
Copy Tables with Azure AD Credentials
Preserving of Blob Tags During Clone
Lease Operations on ADLS Gen2 Folders

              Azure function app doesn&#x27;t work after unlinking to Azure static web app
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9591 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-function-app-doesn-t-work-after-unlinking-to-azure-static/ba-p/3759599>As we know, we can link existing Azure function app to Azure static web app. After that, the Azure Functions app will be mapped to the /api route of your static web app.
 
In the following example, function app tonytesthttp has been linked to static web app.
 

 
When we try to access the function app outside static webapp, we will encounter Bad Request error. We understand that the static web app must do something to block the request. We can try to unlink the function app from static web app. However, you will find the function app still encounters the same error. How can we make our function app back to normal?
 

 
If you read the official document (Bring your own functions to Azure Static Web Apps | Microsoft Learn) carefully, you will find following statement.
 
If authentication and authorization policies aren&#x27;t already set up on your existing Functions app, then the static web app has exclusive access to the API. To make your Functions app accessible to other applications, add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.
 
It seems that the link operation will add authentication limitation to only allow static webapp to access the function app. If you navigate to the authentication setting of the function app, you will find the static webapp was added as an identity provider. Even we unlink the function app to static webapp, the identity provider will not be removed automatically. We need to remove the identity provider manually. After that, the function app will work again.</a>

Reading
I enjoyed reading Ross Barkan’s What to Do About Police,
though it’s bound to generate some controversy. Barkan is,
I think, a geniunely ‘center’ or balanced commentator, if you
consider the political spectrum of major American cities as the
guide. He also has a sense for reading polls and knowing people
enough to identify surprising but true disconnects between what
we think people believe and what they do.
There’s a strangely libertarian tinge to the leftist arguments around defunding and abolishing the police. The NYPD budget is described as “bl…</a>

Authentication is the process of verifying client or server identity before accessing resources to protect information security. Azure App Service provides sets of authentication technologies to protect and secure your web application. However, it is a steep learning curve to know all of them, and we often get lost in the details of the documentations. The purpose of the article is to give you an intuitive way to understand the authentication features in App Service and a high-level summary of different authentication models, their usage scenarios and useful links.
 
Speaking about authentication in App Service, we can make an analogy with network traffic that there is incoming calls and outgoing calls. Similarly, authentic…</a>

There is a symptom with low throughput in Service Bus triggered function due to Service Bus&#x27;s message session enabled. This blog we&#x27;re going to do a lab to demonstrate the cause and effect of this situation.
 
Common causes:
According to session features description (Azure Service Bus message sessions - Azure Service Bus | Microsoft Learn), since a session receiver is created by a client accepting a session. When the session is accepted and held by a client, the client holds an exclusive lock on all messages with that session&#x27;s session ID in the queue or subscription. It will also hold exclusive locks on all messages with the session ID that will arrive later.

Hence, if all the messages are with same session id, there is only one receiver can consume these messages one by one…</a>

Pod Sandboxing compliments other security measures and data protection controls and provides the isolation needed within a single VM node, as well as to protect containers that process sensitive information on AKS. This added functionality also avoids the “operations tax” associated with running standard VM nodes per workload. Pod sandboxing on AKS seamlessly integrates with the existing AKS feature set, making it easy to transition the deployment with simple pod annotation changes to existing workloads while continuing to use existing deployment and monitoring practices. While other methods require that you recompile your code or …</a>

Traffic to their on-premises application has increased beyond expectations and they quickly realized that the on-premises infrastructure doesn&#x27;t provide a cost-efficient means to scale. It is clear to Relecloud that a migration to the cloud offers the most return on investment. However, Relecloud has a small IT team because technology is not their core business.

Function App supports to integrate Managed Identities to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. There are two types of Managed Identities: System-assigned and User-assigned. However, customer would choose User-assigned Managed Identity when the use case is like the workloads that run on multiple resources and can share a single identity or the workloads where resources are recycled frequently, but permissions should stay consistent. In this blog, we&#x27;re going to introduce how to assign a User-Assigned Managed Identity (MI) to Function App that use Azure AD for authorization to access Event Hub resource in Event Hub trigger.

So you need to build an application with minimal operating costs that can also scale to meet the growing demand of your business. This is a perfect scenario for a serverless function, like those built with Azure Functions. With serverless functions you can focus more on the application and less on the infrastructure and operations side of things. However, what happens when you need to include a database in the mix?
 
In this tutorial we&#x27;ll explore how to create a serverless function with Azure Functions and the .NET runtime to interact with MongoDB Atlas. If you&#x27;re not familiar with MongoDB, it offers a flexible data model that can be used for a variety of use cases while being integrated into most applica…</a>

              Azure Contributes to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9535 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-contributes-to-red-hat-s-migration-toolkit-for/ba-p/3736746>Azure and Red Hat have had a long-standing partnership to provide customers with best-in-class cloud solutions, such as jointly-supported Azure Red Hat OpenShift, JBoss EAP on Azure App Service, and deployment templates for JBoss EAP on Azure RHEL VM’s. Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.
 

 
The collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:

Configuring data sources
Java Key Store usage for certificates
Using Maven to deploy to App Service
Proper use of the file system in Azure
Using Azure Service Bus for JMS
Using Azure Active Directory as an identity provider
… and more!

 
Check out this Video Demo for more information.
 
You can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat’s website or install it as a VS Code plugin.

SaaS is a business and software delivery model that enables organisations to offer their solution in a service centric approach at scale usually on a subscription basis. SaaS adoption usually targets growth driven transformation, market expansion, operational simplicity and faster innovation with faster  product releases.
SaaS infrastructures offer better cost efficiencies by leveraging economies of scale, resource pooling and sharing, and increased utilisation of the infrastructure in general. SaaS infra pattern is especially attractive for ISV’s since SaaS accelerates tenant onboarding, enables data collection and mining for platform users (e.g calculate CAC, CLTV, MRR, product consumption metrics…) and makes it much easier to …</a>
