Authentication is the process of verifying client or server identity before accessing resources to protect information security. Azure App Service provides sets of authentication technologies to protect and secure your web application. However, it is a steep learning curve to know all of them, and we often get lost in the details of the documentations. The purpose of the article is to give you an intuitive way to understand the authentication features in App Service and a high-level summary of different authentication models, their usage scenarios and useful links.

Speaking about authentication in App Service, we can make an analogy with network traffic that there is incoming calls and outgoing calls. Similarly, authentic‚Ä¶</a>

There is a symptom with low throughput in Service Bus triggered function due to Service Bus&#x27;s message session enabled. This blog we&#x27;re going to do a lab to demonstrate the cause and effect of this situation.
¬†
Common causes:
According to session features description (Azure Service Bus message sessions - Azure Service Bus | Microsoft Learn), since a session receiver is created by a client accepting a session. When the session is accepted and held by a client, the client holds an exclusive lock on all messages with that session&#x27;s session ID in the queue or subscription. It will also hold exclusive locks on all messages with the session ID that will arrive later.

Hence, if all the messages are with same session id, there is only one receiver can consume these messages one by one‚Ä¶</a>

Confidential containers on ACI give customers the ability to leverage the latest AMD SEV-SNP technology to secure their containerized workloads. Azure customers are increasingly turning to cloud-native, container-based applications to support their workloads. However, these customers are also seeking cloud hosting options that offer the highest levels of data protection, which often require complex infrastructure management and expertise. To address these challenges, we developed confidential containers on Azure Container Instances. This serverless platform allows for running Linux containers within a hardware-based and atteste‚Ä¶</a>

Pod Sandboxing compliments other security measures and data protection controls and provides the isolation needed within a single VM node, as well as to protect containers that process sensitive information on AKS. This added functionality also avoids the ‚Äúoperations tax‚Äù associated with running standard VM nodes per workload. Pod sandboxing on AKS seamlessly integrates with the existing AKS feature set, making it easy to transition the deployment with simple pod annotation changes to existing workloads while continuing to use existing deployment and monitoring practices.

Function App supports to integrate Managed Identities to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. There are two types of Managed Identities: System-assigned and User-assigned.

So you need to build an application with minimal operating costs that can also scale to meet the growing demand of your business. This is a perfect scenario for a serverless function, like those built with Azure Functions. With serverless functions you can focus more on the application and less on the infrastructure and operations side of things. However, what happens when you need to include a database in the mix?
¬†
In this tutorial we&#x27;ll explore how to create a serverless function with Azure Functions and the .NET runtime to interact with MongoDB Atlas. If you&#x27;re not familiar with MongoDB, it offers a flexible data model that can be used for a variety of use cases while being integrated into most applica‚Ä¶</a>

              Azure Contributes to Red Hat‚Äôs Migration Toolkit for Applications
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9535 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-contributes-to-red-hat-s-migration-toolkit-for/ba-p/3736746>Azure and Red Hat have had a long-standing partnership to provide customers with best-in-class cloud solutions, such as jointly-supported Azure Red Hat OpenShift, JBoss EAP on Azure App Service, and deployment templates for JBoss EAP on Azure RHEL VM‚Äôs. Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat‚Äôs Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.
¬†

¬†
The collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:

Configuring data sources
Java Key Store usage for certificates
Using Maven to deploy to App Service
Proper use of the file system in Azure
Using Azure Service Bus for JMS
Using Azure Active Directory as an identity provider
‚Ä¶ and more!

¬†
Check out this Video Demo¬†for more information.
¬†
You can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat‚Äôs website or install it as a VS Code plugin.

SaaS is a business and software delivery model that enables organisations to offer their solution in a service centric approach at scale usually on a subscription basis. SaaS adoption usually targets growth driven transformation, market expansion, operational simplicity and faster innovation with faster¬† product releases.
SaaS infrastructures offer better cost efficiencies by leveraging economies of scale, resource pooling and sharing, and increased utilisation of the infrastructure in general. SaaS infra pattern is especially attractive for ISV‚Äôs since SaaS accelerates tenant onboarding, enables data collection and mining for platform users (e.g calculate CAC, CLTV, MRR, product consumption metrics‚Ä¶) and makes it much easier to ‚Ä¶</a>

There are two parts to WordPress:

WP Admin: Also called the backend, admin panel, or admin dashboard, this is the admin area where you can manage your website. You can edit posts and pages, install themes and plugins, add or remove users, and change website settings.
Frontend: This is the section which is accessible to your users. This is where your users can read blog posts, make purchases, or participate in a forum, depending on the kind of website you build using WordPress.

A relatively common problem is that the WP Admin has low performance even when the frontend works fast for your users. Most performance enhancements that you do makes only your frontend faster. This makes it difficult ‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
When we create App Service Certificate (Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn) in Azure Portal, sometime we are not using it in the App Service but use it for Azure VM or on-prem VM. Moreover, we will use it in some Azure resources (such as upload the certificate to Azure Application Gateway).
¬†
However, after you export the App Service Certificate from Azure Portal, when you are going to upload it to Azure Application Gateway or use it in the Azure VM or on-prem VM, you would find out sometimes it would need the &quot;password&quot;. But you don&#x27;t know what the password is for the ‚Ä¶</a>

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the managed Kubernetes offering from Azure, allows customers to offload the operational overhead to Azure, thus letting the user focus primarily on their workloads and business logic. We are seeing two sets of user trends along the Kubernetes adoption curve. First, organizations that are already using containers and/or Kubernetes in their on-premises and cloud environments are looking to AKS to reduce their operational burden and leverage the Azure cloud ecosystem. Secondly, we also see organizations earlier in the adoption cycle that are looking to experiment and discover Kubernetes‚Äô fit‚Ä¶</a>
