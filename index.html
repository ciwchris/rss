Can you believe Spring is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year? ¬†We could not have gotten here without our millions of Spring developers across the globe, thank you! Spring has been an essential tool for Java developers, and it continues to grow and innovate at a fast pace. From the onset, Azure and VMware Tanzu have been trusted partners to customers for running mission-critical Java and Spring workloads. Our commitment and fondness for the Java Spring developer community have never wavered.

              Use preview environment for test in static web app
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9683 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/use-preview-environment-for-test-in-static-web-app/ba-p/3870476>Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.
¬†
Here are the steps to create a preview environment:
¬†
1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it &quot;dev&quot;.


¬†
2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include &quot;dev&quot; in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.

¬†
3. Set &quot;production_branch&quot; to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.

¬†
4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named &#x27;dev&#x27; for the dev branch.

¬†
5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the &quot;deployment_environment&quot; to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.

¬†

¬†
The main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named.¬†
¬†
Overall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment. The choice of environment type typically depends on the specific needs and development process of your project.</a>

              KMS v2 on Azure Kubernetes Service now Supporting Encryption of Secrets Beyond the 2k Limit!
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9691 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/kms-v2-on-azure-kubernetes-service-now-supporting-encryption-of/ba-p/3870488>Encrypting data at rest is a primary step in securing a Kubernetes cluster. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.
For clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.</a>

              TLS/SSL Binding for custom domain contain special character
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9790 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/tls-ssl-binding-for-custom-domain-contain-special-character/ba-p/3864951>Overview:
We can secure a custom DNS name with the help of TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service.
¬†
When hosting a website on Azure App Service, it is important to ensure that the site is secure and can be accessed via a custom domain name. This can be achieved by using TLS/SSL binding, which encrypts data transmitted to and from the website, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is protected. With this setup, users can access the website via a custom domain name, which adds an extra layer of professionalism and branding to the site.
¬†
Issue:
The users are not able to purchase and bind the app service certificate for their app service having a custom domain with a special character from Azure Portal.
¬†
Solution and¬†recommendations:

Azure by default does not provide the facility to purchase the custom domain with the special character except periods and dashes.

¬†


The user can purchase the custom domain outside Azure with special characters apart from periods and dashes.
In this case, the user will not be able to purchase the App Service Certificate from Azure with the custom domain consists a special character.
To purchase and bind the Certificate with such domain from Azure Portal, the custom domain first needs to be converted to its Punny code using the below converter:

¬†
Punycode converter (IDN converter), Punycode to Unicode :wrench:(punycoder.com)

¬†

Purchase the certificate with the Punny code custom domain and bind the certificate with the app service custom domain.

¬†

Browse the app service to verify the SSL Certificate.

Happy Learning!

the birthplace of Mapbox.
This one will be quick because I‚Äôm between one thing
and another!
Listening
Dry Daniel by Buke and Gase

Buke and Gase released some music they recorded a while ago,
and there are some hits in it. I especially love this
track ‚ÄòBubbles,‚Äô which really could be a radio hit.
I‚Äôve also been listening to Spellcaster: The Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried,
which will probably be only one of 20 podcasts, TV shows,
movies, books about SBF. But it‚Äôs pretty good.
Bloomberg puts out good content!
Reading
I read Capital Without Borders,
which is a great add-on if you‚Äôve already read Piketty‚Äôs Capital
or anything by Zucman, Saez, etc. It really gives you a level-headed
perspective of what exactly the wealth management industry does,
and how it affects the word.
Right now, I‚Äôm reading Crabgrass Kingdom,
which I found via the New York Times piece on Vienna.
It‚Äôs pretty good, but unfortunately kind of dated - when it was
published in the 80s, US cities hadn‚Äôt started their arc back
toward growth and power. Still pretty good, though!
The Vienna piece is also highly recommended. Very few commentators
have said so clearly that we can‚Äôt fix America‚Äôs housing problems
without letting go of our obsession with owning houses as investments.
The Henry George Program

              TeX Live package reorganization
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 207 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/tex-live-package-reorganization/>Starting from version 2023.66594-9, TeX Live packages have been reorganized to mirror upstream collections. Even though the new texlive-basic replaces the old texlive-core, many of the texlive-core contents (including language specific files) are now split between different packages. To find out which Arch package contains a specific CTAN package, you can use the tlmgr utility, eg.
$ tlmgr info euler | grep collection
collection:  collection-latexrecommended

which means the euler CTAN package is contained in texlive-latexrecommended. You may also use pacman -F to query for specific files.
A new metapackage texlive-meta is available to install all subpackages (except for language specific ones), and the new texlive-doc package provides the full documentation for offline use.</a>

            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/openblas-0323-2-update-requires-manual-intervention/>The openblas package prior to version 0.3.23-2 doesn&#x27;t ship optimized
LAPACK routine and CBLAS/LAPACKE interfaces for compatibility. This
decision has been reverted now, and the ability to choose a different
default system BLAS/LAPACK implementation while keeping openblas
installed is now provided to allow future co-installation of BLIS,
ATLAS, etc.
The default BLAS implementation will be used for most packages like
NumPy or R. Please install &quot;blas-openblas&quot; and &quot;blas64-openblas&quot; to make
OpenBLAS the default BLAS implementation, just like the old behavior.
Unfortunately you will get errors on updating if you currently have
OpenBLAS installed as the default BLAS implementation:
error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
:: installing openblas (0.3.23-2) breaks dependency &#x27;blas&#x27; required by cblas
:: installing openblas (0.3.23-2) breaks dependency &#x27;blas&#x27; required by
lapack
Please append your preferred default BLAS implementation to the regular
-Syu command line to get around it. For example:
pacman -Syu blas-openblas

or
pacman -Syu blas</a>
