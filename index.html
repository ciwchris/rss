¬†
Pod Sandboxing compliments other security measures and data protection controls and provides the isolation needed within a single VM node, as well as to protect containers that process sensitive information on AKS. This added functionality also avoids the ‚Äúoperations tax‚Äù associated with running standard VM nodes per workload. Pod sandboxing on AKS seamlessly integrates with the existing AKS feature set, making it easy to transition the deployment with simple pod annotation changes to existing workloads while continuing to use existing deployment and monitoring practices. While other methods require that you recompile your code or ‚Ä¶</a>

Traffic to their on-premises application has increased beyond expectations and they quickly realized that the on-premises infrastructure doesn&#x27;t provide a cost-efficient means to scale. It is clear to Relecloud that a migration to the cloud offers the most return on investment. However, Relecloud has a small IT team because technology is not their core business. The charter for this small IT team is to meet the increased business demand as quickly as possible with minimal investments in the existing monolithic app. Sounds familiar?

Function App supports to integrate Managed Identities to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. There are two types of Managed Identities: System-assigned and User-assigned. However, customer would choose User-assigned Managed Identity when the use case is like the workloads that run on multiple resources and can share a single identity or the workloads where resources are recycled frequently, but permissions should stay consistent. In this blog, we&#x27;re going to introduce how to assign a User-Assigned Managed Identity (MI) to Function App that use Azure AD for authorization to access Event Hub resource in Event Hub trigger.

So you need to build an application with minimal operating costs that can also scale to meet the growing demand of your business. This is a perfect scenario for a serverless function, like those built with Azure Functions. With serverless functions you can focus more on the application and less on the infrastructure and operations side of things. However, what happens when you need to include a database in the mix?
¬†
In this tutorial we&#x27;ll explore how to create a serverless function with Azure Functions and the .NET runtime to interact with MongoDB Atlas. If you&#x27;re not familiar with MongoDB, it offers a flexible data model that can be used for a variety of use cases while being integrated into most applica‚Ä¶</a>

              Azure Contributes to Red Hat‚Äôs Migration Toolkit for Applications
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9535 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-contributes-to-red-hat-s-migration-toolkit-for/ba-p/3736746>Azure and Red Hat have had a long-standing partnership to provide customers with best-in-class cloud solutions, such as jointly-supported Azure Red Hat OpenShift, JBoss EAP on Azure App Service, and deployment templates for JBoss EAP on Azure RHEL VM‚Äôs. Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat‚Äôs Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.
¬†

¬†
The collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:

Configuring data sources
Java Key Store usage for certificates
Using Maven to deploy to App Service
Proper use of the file system in Azure
Using Azure Service Bus for JMS
Using Azure Active Directory as an identity provider
‚Ä¶ and more!

¬†
Check out this Video Demo¬†for more information.
¬†
You can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat‚Äôs website or install it as a VS Code plugin.

SaaS is a business and software delivery model that enables organisations to offer their solution in a service centric approach at scale usually on a subscription basis. SaaS adoption usually targets growth driven transformation, market expansion, operational simplicity and faster innovation with faster¬† product releases.
SaaS infrastructures offer better cost efficiencies by leveraging economies of scale, resource pooling and sharing, and increased utilisation of the infrastructure in general. SaaS infra pattern is especially attractive for ISV‚Äôs since SaaS accelerates tenant onboarding, enables data collection and mining for platform users (e.g calculate CAC, CLTV, MRR, product consumption metrics‚Ä¶) and makes it much easier to ‚Ä¶</a>

There are two parts to WordPress:

WP Admin: Also called the backend, admin panel, or admin dashboard, this is the admin area where you can manage your website. You can edit posts and pages, install themes and plugins, add or remove users, and change website settings.
Frontend: This is the section which is accessible to your users. This is where your users can read blog posts, make purchases, or participate in a forum, depending on the kind of website you build using WordPress.

A relatively common problem is that the WP Admin has low performance even when the frontend works fast for your users. Most performance enhancements that you do makes only your frontend faster. This makes it difficult ‚Ä¶</a>

When we create App Service Certificate (Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn) in Azure Portal, sometime we are not using it in the App Service but use it for Azure VM or on-prem VM. Moreover, we will use it in some Azure resources (such as upload the certificate to Azure Application Gateway).

However, after you export the App Service Certificate from Azure Portal, when you are going to upload it to Azure Application Gateway or use it in the Azure VM or on-prem VM, you would find out sometimes it would need the &quot;password&quot;.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the managed Kubernetes offering from Azure, allows customers to offload the operational overhead to Azure, thus letting the user focus primarily on their workloads and business logic. We are seeing two sets of user trends along the Kubernetes adoption curve. First, organizations that are already using containers and/or Kubernetes in their on-premises and cloud environments are looking to AKS to reduce their operational burden and leverage the Azure cloud ecosystem. Secondly, we also see organizations earlier in the adoption cycle that are looking to experiment and discover Kubernetes‚Äô fit‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/01/28/placemark.html>Yesterday, I announced that I was joining Val.town, but that Placemark lived. And I haven‚Äôt really given an update on Placemark, the product and business, in a while. Writing about an operating business is a different thing that writing feature announcements or essays about technology: the ramifications of honesty, spin, or disclosure are so much more vast and unpredictable. This is why we often learn about people‚Äôs trials or a company‚Äôs struggles only years later, but at the time everyone exudes confidence.
But, having drafted something about this a few times and edited myself into knots, I figure it‚Äôs better to just write something. The best writing always comes after I‚Äôve scrapped a draft anyway.
The company behind Placemark, Working Idea LLC, is still a bootstrapped, single-person enti‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/01/27/valtown.html>Last week I joined val.town as Steve Krouse‚Äôs cofounder. Val.town is a system for programming in the small, for writing short programs in TypeScript that can link together into something larger. It‚Äôs for writing that scheduled web scraper or basic API that you wanted to make but didn‚Äôt want to add to your pile of servers on AWS or GCP. It‚Äôs already a lot of fun to use, and is going to keep getting better.

Placemark lives. It‚Äôs still getting better every week. It‚Äôs been about two years since I formally started it, and it‚Äôs grown into a great product with the help of supportive and creative customers. I‚Äôve been relatively quiet about Placemark-the-business, despite writing a steady flow of blog posts on features &amp; improvements on placemark.io. But, soon - I‚Äôll publish a state of Placemark in the near future.
I‚Äôm tremendously excited about Val.town. It‚Äôs a small team in Brooklyn and Seattle, with lots of creative energy. I think we‚Äôll be able to take this opportunity and make something great, something that in retrospect always should have existed.</a>

Again, you do not have to install these components yourself. All you need to do is enable and/or configure your container app to use these components.

In this blog, we will see how can we scale Container Apps based on Redis Streams with the Azure managed instance of Redis, i.e. Azure Cache for Redis.¬†We will be¬†referring to the KEDA trigger specification for Redis Streams (Scale applications based on Redis Streams) to configure our Container App.¬†This specification describes the Redis-s‚Ä¶</a>
