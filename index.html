Well, we have some tips. 
We walked through how to set up, run and analyze user loads with Azure Load Testing in part one of this series. In part two we will test different load patterns to show you how simulate them in Apache JMeter. A load pattern specifies how the simulated user load is adjusted during a load test.
While you might run smoke tests regularly with minimal load to avoid regressions, big events present scenarios to consider different types of load testing.
In this article we‚Äôll discuss step loads, spike tests, breakpoint testing and soak testing patterns.¬†Let‚Äôs get to it!

              Creating an authorized Microservice - Secured Blob Exchange

Many ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) are exchanging information with devices, applications, services, or humans. In many cases the information passed can be a file or a blob. Each of these ISVs would need to implement such a service. In the past few months, I discussed this capability with several (over 4) different customers, each with slightly unique needs. When I tried to generalize the need, it was clear: they wanted a quick, safe means to exchange files with customers or devices.¬†
¬†

¬†
As a service provider, I need my customers to upload content in a secure, easy-to-maintain micro-service exposed as an API (application programming interfaces) so that I can process the content uploaded and perform an action on it.¬†

Many customers try to migrate across subscriptions, resource groups, and so on. Sometimes they use uploaded certificates in the App service instead of ASC.This blog will be helpful when they migrate App service resources with uploaded certificates. I wrote this blog for testing based on Azure docs.
¬†
See¬†move across subscriptions¬†

¬†
Testing Steps
1. Prerequisites
2. Upload and bind certificates to App Service
3. Do the migration
4. Validate the result
¬†
1. Prerequisites
- App Service- App service domain:¬†in my case, tlsmigrationtest.com- Add a custom domain to App Service: SSL isn&#x27;t bound yet

¬†
2. Upload and bind certificates
Upload certificate (.pfx) and bind certificate to the app service domain.
A. App service &gt; TLS/SSL settings &gt; Private Key Certificates (.pfx) &gt; Upload Certificate

¬†
B. Upload the certificate

C. Bind certificates
App Service &gt; Custom domains &gt; Add bindings

¬†
After finishing the above steps, you can see the SSL binding to the App Service domain.

¬†
3. Migration across subscriptions with uploaded certificates
A. For migration, go to your resource group.
¬†
B. Before moving resources you must click &quot;show hidden types&quot;
When you check &quot;show hidden types&quot;, you can see uploaded certificates.

¬†
C. Check all App service resources and click move to another subscription
You must move all App Service resources together such as App Service, App service domain, and certificates.
Check limitation¬†Move Azure App Service resources across resource groups or subscriptions - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn

¬†
D. Validate the result
Before you migrate app service resources, you can see the validation status.
If you can see succeeded status like below, you will be able to migrate successfully.

¬†
4. Success migration
Uploaded app service certificates are still bound to the App Service domain in the new subscription.</a>

So you&#x27;re building serverless applications with Microsoft Azure Functions, but you need to persist data to a database. What do you do about controlling the number of concurrent connections to your database from the function? What happens if the function currently connected to your database shuts down or a new instance comes online to scale with demand?
¬†
The concept of serverless in general, whether that be through a function or database, is great because it is designed for the modern application. Applications that scale on-demand reduce the maintenance overhead and applications that are pay as you go reduce unnecessary costs.

              Adding HSTS header in the NGINX based App Service
              <span class="post-metadata">(31 min | 9417 words)</span> 
            </summary>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/adding-hsts-header-in-the-nginx-based-app-service/ba-p/3666106>Azure App Service on Linux images using PHP 8.x are now bundled with NGINX instead of Apache. The use of¬†.htaccess¬†files will not work for NGINX as these are used for Apache only. This will require the need to setup a custom startup script and modifying the existing NGINX site configuration.
¬†

¬†
Navigate to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the¬†Development Tools¬†section, select¬†SSH¬†then¬†Go --&gt;.
Modifying the default site config
You will want to make a copy of the existing configuration and place the file inside the¬†/home/site¬†directory.
¬†


cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /home/site/default


Once you created a default page as in the previous step, please update the location block to add HSTS Header and create the custom startup script as mentioned below
¬†¬†
location / {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
index¬† index.php index.html index.htm hostingstart.html;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security &quot;max-age&#x3D;31536000; includeSubDomains&quot; always;
}
Creating the custom startup script
You will now need to create a custom startup script and save the file as¬†/home/site/startup.sh



#!/bin/bash

cp /home/site/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
service nginx reload


In the custom startup script, we are doing the following:

Overriding the existing¬†/etc/nginx/sites-available/default¬†file with the¬†/home/site/default¬†file.
Reloading the NGINX service to make the updates take effect.

Updating the application settings
Navigate back to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the¬†Settings¬†section, select¬†Configuration.
Go over to the¬†General Settings¬†section of the¬†Configuration¬†blade.
For the¬†Startup Command¬†enter the following:¬†/home/site/startup.sh
Save these settings and navigate to your application¬†https://{sitename}.azurewebsites.net/

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.</a>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they&#x27;d been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.</a>

Now scientists have shown that the same may be true for cells, uncovering a newly-discovered mechanism that might help prevent the build-up of tangles of proteins commonly seen in dementia. Scientists have identified a new mechanism that appears to reverse the build-up of aggregates, not by eliminating them completely, but rather by &#x27;refolding&#x27; them.</a>

The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population&#x27;s increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.</a>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220426101641.htm>A study is the first to examine if sex significantly affects cognitive outcomes in people who follow individually-tailored, multi-domain clinical interventions. The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals&#x27; overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.</a>
