CD (Continuous Deployment) is a common way to pull the updated docker image from docker registry (such as Azure Continer Registray or Docker Hub etc) to App Service automatically.

 

While if App Service enables Private Endpoint, the webhook from container registry should be blocked with 403 since the public access to the App Service kudu site (advanced tool site) is blocked by default. And when webhook event is trying sent to app service via Private Endpoint, it should fail with IP forbidden.


 
With the situation, this blog provide a workaround by allowing webhook IP to access App Service kudu site via public access and keep the remaining traffic go through Private Endpoint. So the diagram as below:

So, we are offering you a playground for a limited period - a free hosting plan to and explore and experiment with WordPress on App Service. This will help you understand the offering better before you make a long-term investment.
 



Note: This hosting plan is not suitable for Production workloads. So, it is highly recommended that you do not use this plan for production setup.

Application Configuration Service for VMware Tanzu (ACS) is one of the commercial VMware Tanzu components. It enables the management of Kubernetes-native ConfigMap resources that are populated from properties defined in one or more Git repositories.
 
Application Configuration Service is offered in two versions: Gen1 and Gen2. The Gen1 version mainly serves existing customers for backward compatibility purposes and is supported only until April 30, 2024. New service instances should use Gen2. The Gen2 version uses flux as the backend to communicate with Git repositories and provides better performance compared to Gen1.

              How to detect Java dependency version conflict using IDEA Maven Helper
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9847 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-detect-java-dependency-version-conflict-using-idea-maven/ba-p/3915091>A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.
 
1. Install the plugin
In IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.

 
2. Leverage the plugin
Open the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.

You will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.

 
3. Resolve conflict
To resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.
After resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.

 
4. Conclusion
Dependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/09/01/recently.html>Early this month I arrived at work to see a Concorde parked in the
Brooklyn Navy Yard. It’s
been fun to identify the ships docked there, but an airplane was new,
especially such a rare one. I guess a lot of airplane knowledge from
my childhood has stayed with me, and being greeted by this Concorde,
and watching the new Top Gun has brought it back.
This one’s G-BOAD,
the Concorde that’s been flown the most, and it usually lives at
the Intrepid, but
it badly needs a new coat of paint, so it’s in the Navy Yard for that.
Pretty fun! They brought it there on a barge.
Watching


The only great film I watched this month was Snatch.
Brad Pitt’s accent in the film, which is supposed to be that of an
Irish Traveller, is a big highlight.


On the shorter video front, I’ve been enjoying Berm Peak, whi…</a>

In this blog post, we’ll cover how App Service users can navigate to Azure Load Testing amidst diagnosing performance bottlenecks.
 
Azure Load Testing is a fully managed load testing service that enables you to easily generate large-scale load. It provides actionable insights that can help identify performance, scalability and capacity issues. Azure customers can monitor their applications in Azure Load Testing during the load simulation to analyze the consumption of their resources.

Below are few experiments with different configurations of Gunicorn. 
 

Create Python Flask App that sleeps for two seconds and responds with message &#x27;Finished&#x27;. This is to effectively mimic application making an outbound HTTP call or database call.
from flask import Flask
import time

app &#x3D; Flask(__name__)

@app.route(&#x27;/&#x27;)
def hello_world():
    time.sleep(2)
    return &quot;Finished&quot;

if __name__ &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;__main__&#x27;:
    app.run()​

Create script with 5 threads which will make 5 simultaneous HTTP calls to this Flask API.

In that post, we also stated that we would have another update in early 2023, but unfortunately this did not happen. However, we’ve made great progress since the last post, and today we’d like to share where we’re at with the isolated worker model, and how we’re thinking about the future.
 
Isolated worker model assessment
The isolated worker model you author your functions in a way that’s aligned with how the .NET ecosystem has evolved. It offers a rich dependency injection model, full control over main() and app dependencies, improved reliability, additional features like invocation middleware, and more. Our deepest than…</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/08/29/an-open-core.html>A few weeks ago, HashiCorp switched its default license for future product releases to the BSL license. The BSL license was created by the people at MariaDB in 2017 to give companies a way to release software as open source but prohibit their competitors from re-hosting that software and competing with them. In HashiCorp’s case, the license also has a stipulation that their code becomes simply liberally open source under the MPL, four years after it’s published under the BSL.
This prompted the usual outcry from the open source community, and some intelligent analysis. For the legal license analysis, you can do no better than reading Kyle E. Mitchell’s article and his summary of the strategy and list of the implementations at duallicensing.com.

You can make these tasks happen whenever you want, following a schedule, or when something specific occurs. These jobs work well for things like dealing with data, teaching computers, or situations where you need quick computing power without leaving a trace.
 
This blog helps you in deploying an event driven job using Azure Container apps and Azure Service Bus. In this example, the trigger will be a message in Service bus Queue and the Azure container app Job reads the message present in the queue and prints the message in container app console log.

Scaling out Socket.IO apps can be frustrating for developers.
Overwhelmingly, users reported their love of the “intuitive APIs” and how easy it is to get productive with the library once they get over the initial learning curve. However, scaling out a Socket.IO app is where the most frustration and difficulty lie.

By default, PHP version is getting displayed as in the below screenshot-

 
 Updating PHP Settings-

Go to your KUDU site https://.scm.azurewebsites.net.
Select Bash or SSH from the top menu.
In Bash/SSH, go to your &quot;/home/site&quot; directory.
Create a directory called &quot;ini&quot; (i.e. mkdir ini)
Change directories to &quot;ini&quot;.
We&#x27;ll need to create an &quot;ini&quot; file to add our settings to.  In this example, I&#x27;m using &quot;settings.ini&quot;.  There are no file editors such as Vi, Vim, or Nano so we&#x27;ll simply use echo to add the settings to the file.  I&#x27;m changing the expose_php setting to Off.  Below is the command that I used to add the setting and create an &quot;settings.ini&quot; file if one doesn&#x27;t already exist.

 NOTE:  If you already have an extensions.ini file, you can use the same command which will add the new setting to the file. 
/home/site/ini&gt;echo &quot; expose_php &#x3D; Off &quot; &gt;&gt; settings.ini
If using SSH, you can use vi to create/edit the settings file using the following commands.

 vi settings.ini
 Press &quot;i&quot; on your keyboard to start editing and add the following.

 expose_php &#x3D; Off  
3. Press &quot;Esc&quot;, then &quot;:wq!&quot; and enter to save.
Add an Application Setting-
We&#x27;ll now need to go to the Azure Portal and add an Application Setting to scan the &quot;ini&quot; directory
              1) Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and select your App Service Linux PHP application.
              2) Select Application Settings for the app.
              3) Under the Application settings section, press the &quot;+ Add new setting&quot;.
              4) For the App Setting Name, enter &quot;PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR&quot;. For the value, enter &quot;/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini&quot;
 
Testing – 
Go to kudu site and run the command below and you can verify that PHP header is removed.
