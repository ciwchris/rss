Once secrets are defined at the application level, secured values are available to revisions in your container apps. Additionally, you can reference secured values inside scale rules.
¬†
This blog provides a detailed, step-by-step procedure for removing secrets associated with an Azure Container Registry (ACR). In this example, we will walk through the process of creating a Container App with an image reference from the ACR, which automatically generates a secret. We will then attempt to remove this secret and observe its behaviour throughout the process.

Secrets are scoped to an application, outside of any specific revision of an application.
Adding, removing, or changing secrets doesn&#x27;t generat‚Ä¶</a>

              Troubleshooting Log Stream data not loading/populating in App Services
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9949 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/troubleshooting-log-stream-data-not-loading-populating-in-app/ba-p/3944370>Overview
Before you stream logs in real-time, enable the log type that you want. Any information written to the console output or files ending in .txt, .log, or .htm that are stored in the /home/LogFiles directory (D:\home\LogFiles) is streamed by App Service.
¬†
Note: Some types of logging buffer write to the log file, which can result in out of order events in the stream. For example, an application log entry that occurs when a user visits a page may be displayed in the stream before the corresponding HTTP log entry for the page request.
¬†
In Azure portal
To stream logs in the Azure portal, navigate to your app and select Log Stream.
¬†
Troubleshooting StepsCheck Access to the kudu site.
¬†

The Log Stream fetches the data from kudu site, and it is important to have access to the kudu site.‚Ä¶</a>

If you&#x27;re running distributed applications on JBoss EAP, you know that clustering is essential for data consistency and fault tolerance.

              Masked email is a killer feature for Fastmail

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/09/24/masked-email.html>I last sang the praises of Fastmail in 2018, writing about how it‚Äôs pretty easy to avoid Google now that Google‚Äôs products are relatively middling. I‚Äôve been using Fastmail exclusively since then and have only good things to say about it. The user interface is rock-solid and fast, and there have been very few times that they‚Äôve had a server outage. But it‚Äôs just been qualitatively better than Gmail, not differentiated by a feature.
Masked email
That‚Äôs changed: I think that Fastmail‚Äôs ‚ÄúMasked Email‚Äù is a good reason for the Gmail-faithful to switch. It‚Äôs both a fantastic way to manage spam sources and a real win for privacy.

              Changes to default password hashing algorithm and umask settings
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 319 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/changes-to-default-password-hashing-algorithm-and-umask-settings/>With shadow &gt;&#x3D; 4.14.0, Arch Linux&#x27;s default password hashing algorithm changed from SHA512 to yescrypt [1].
Furthermore, the umask [2] settings are now configured in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile.
This should not require any manual intervention.
Reasons for Yescrypt
The password-based key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing scheme yescrypt has been chosen due to its adoption (readily available in libxcrypt, which is used by pam [3]) and its stronger resilience towards password cracking attempts over SHA512.
Although the winner of the Password Hashing Competition [4] has been argon2, this even more resilient algorithm is not yet available in libxcrypt [5][6].
Configuring yescrypt
The YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR setting in /etc/login.defs is currently without effect, until pam implements reading its value [7]. If a YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR higher (or lower) than the default (5) is needed, it can be set using the rounds option of the pam_unix [8] module (i.e. in /etc/pam.d/system-auth).
General list of changes
yescrypt is used as default password hashing algorithm, instead of SHA512
pam honors the chosen ENCRYPT_METHOD in /etc/login.defs and does not override the chosen method anymore
changes in the filesystem (&gt;&#x3D; 2023.09.18) and pambase (&gt;&#x3D; 20230918) packages ensure, that umask is set centrally in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile

If so, you might be interested in using Managed Identities (MSI) or Service Principals to authenticate and authorize your app service to another app service that is protected by Azure Active Directory (AAD) using built-in authentication (Easy-Auth).

In this article, I will show you how to use MSI or Service Principal of app1 to access app2, which is a custom resource that requires AAD authentication.

Normally, we would use the MSI-validator tool to test the functionality of MSI. However, it only supports specific resources and requires a pre-defined resource value. Currently, it can only use the following resources: default, keyvault, storage, and ‚Ä¶</a>

The short answer was no, so we built one!¬†

              Init Containers in Azure Container Apps : Database Initialization
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9861 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/init-containers-in-azure-container-apps-database-initialization/ba-p/3931271>Suppose you&#x27;re deploying a web application that relies on a database. Instead of manually configuring the database each time you deploy your application, you can use an Init Container to handle this task. The Init Container can run scripts to create tables, seed initial data, or set up the database schema. Once the database is ready, the main application container can safely start, knowing that the required database structure is in place.
¬†
The below example defines an init container which runs under the same pod as main app container, seeds data to an existing Azure MySQL Database which will be used by the main web app container to serve contents onto the landing page.
¬†

¬†
The init container inserts a record into an existing table named myguests in Azure My SQL DB using a python script. The script contains code for connecting to the Database alongside inserting record into the Database. This data will then be retrieved and used by the main app container which is also running a python Flask based web application and return the value in the landing page.
¬†
Dockerfile for Init Container
¬†
¬†
¬†
FROM python
COPY . .
RUN pip install mysql &amp;&amp; pip install mysql-connector-python
CMD [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;test.py&quot;]

¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
Python Script for Init Container

  user&#x3D;&quot;*******&quot;,
  password&#x3D;&quot;*******&quot;,
  database&#x3D;&quot;*****&quot;
)

mycursor &#x3D; mydb.cursor()

sql &#x3D; &quot;INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES (&#x27;John&#x27;, &#x27;Doe&#x27;, &#x27;test@outlook.com&#x27;)&quot;

The last thing you want is for a code change or new feature to negatively impact your app&#x27;s performance. That&#x27;s where load testing swoops in to save the day. But what if we told you there&#x27;s an even cooler way to handle load testing? Yep, you guessed it ‚Äì automating it with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Azure Pipelines and Azure Load Testing.
¬†
Why automate load tests with CI/CD?
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, let&#x27;s understand why automating load tests with CI/CD is a game-changer:

Detect issues early: By integrating load tests into your CI/CD pipeline, you can detect performance issues early . Address problems before they reach production, reducing the impact on end-users.

              Function app deployment from Azure DevOps never complete
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9791 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/function-app-deployment-from-azure-devops-never-complete/ba-p/3912288>Symptom:
When using zip deploy way to deploy¬†to function app from Azure DevOps, the new deployment never complete at DevOps side until manually cancel it.
¬†
Bad:¬†

¬†
Good:

¬†
Resolution:¬†
1. Enable debug log at DevOps side and then check if there are many¬†requests to &quot;/api/deployments/latest&quot; with 202, if yes, continue.¬†¬†
2. Check under &quot;LogFiles/kudu/trace&quot; in kudu portal, find log with name like below at the same time range for current deployment. If many logs show the deployment is pending at same deployment id, then continue.¬†

3. Go to &quot;site/deployments&quot; in kudu portal to find the folder whose name is same as the deployment id, then check status.xml or status_complete.xml and log.log inside the folder. If status in status.xml or status_complete.xml is not Success or Failed, then we can try to resolve the issue by removing this folder under¬†&quot;site/deployments&quot;.
4. Check the log with name like below under &quot;LogFiles/kudu/trace&quot; at the same time for the non-completed deployment task to get more details of the cause why the deployment at that time was not completed.</a>

              Init Containers in Azure Container Apps : File Processing
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9842 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/init-containers-in-azure-container-apps-file-processing/ba-p/3930675>In some scenarios, you might need to preprocess files before they&#x27;re used by your application. For instance, you&#x27;re deploying a¬†machine learning¬†model that relies on precomputed data files. An Init Container can download, extract, or preprocess these files, ensuring they are ready for the main application container. This approach simplifies the deployment process and ensures that your application always has access to the required data.
¬†
The below example defines a simple Pod that has an init container which downloads a file from some resource to a file share which is shared between the init and main app container. The main app container is running a php-apache image and serves the landing page using the index.php file downloaded into the shared file space.
¬†

¬†
The init container mounts the shared volume at¬†/mydir , and the main application container mounts the shared volume at¬†/var/www/html. The init container runs the following command to download the file and then terminates: wget -O /mydir/index.php¬†http://info.cern.ch.¬†
¬†
Configurations and dockerfile for init container:
¬†

Mount the storage file share on the environment level
Create init container with mounting file share named init on path /mydir:


¬†
¬†

Dockerfile¬†for init which downloads an index.php file under /mydir:

¬†
FROM busybox:1.28 
WORKDIR / 
ENTRYPOINT [&quot;wget&quot;, &quot;-O&quot;, &quot;/mydir/index.php&quot;, &quot;http://info.cern.ch&quot;]
¬†
¬†
¬†
Configuration for main app container:
¬†

Create main app container mounting file share named init on path /var/www/html:


¬†
¬†

Main app container configuration which uses php-apache image and serves the index.php file from DocumentRoot /var/www/html:

Output:

Azure Container App Init Containers are specialized containers that run to completion before application containers are started in a replica, and they can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in your container app image. Init containers are useful for performing initialization logic such as setting up accounts, running setup scripts, and configuring databases.

Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:

Init containers always run to completion.
Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.

In the diagram below, your client will connect to the application gateway through the public Ip address. The application gateway will connect privately and securely to your App Service application using a private endpoint which is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your private network.

A container image from an unknown source could include vulnerabilities and malicious code injected by bad actors. To mitigate container supply chain threats, enterprises and open-source communities are exploring safeguards. Signing container images enables software consumers to detect tampering and ensure the authenticity of the containerized workloads.

              Best practise for Private Endpoint Enabled Docker container App Service
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9948 words)</span>

CD (Continuous Deployment) is a common way to pull the updated docker image from docker registry (such as Azure Continer Registray or Docker Hub etc) to App Service automatically.

¬†

While if App Service enables Private Endpoint, the webhook from container registry should be blocked with 403 since the public access to the App Service kudu site (advanced tool site) is blocked by default. And when webhook event is trying sent to app service via Private Endpoint, it should fail with IP forbidden.


¬†
With the situation, this blog provide a workaround by allowing webhook IP to access App Service kudu site via public access and keep the¬†remaining traffic go through Private Endpoint. So the diagram as below:
