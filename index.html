2.15.3 the ansible-core package will stop shipping documentation and a default configuration example under /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg.
Regarding the documentation, it is available online: https://docs.ansible.com/

ansible-config init --disabled &gt; ansible.cfg
After updating from ansible-core &#x3D; 2.15.3-1, everyone using a custom global Ansible configuration file stored under /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg will have their configuration saved as a pacsave file.

Recently, I have touched on a case when the customer would like to interact with Azure PowerShell Function to work with Storage Account and SFTP server. There are some advantages why customers would like to apply for this solution:

Azure Functions provide the convenience of URI/timer-triggered maintenance tasks.

Demand Analysis

Azure Static Web Apps is the ideal service for hosting modern frontend web apps and static sites on Azure. Many customers rely on Static Web Apps to host their HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, Angular, Blazor or NextJS apps (among others!), and they complement these with their APIs, microservices and other services such as databases. At times though, these downstream services are isolated within a virtual network, preventing access from Static Web Apps‚Äô managed Azure Functions.

This guide is to help you troubleshoot Azure SQL connectivity and authentication issues on Linux App Services.
Note:¬†At the time of writing this cannot be executed in Linux Function Apps, since we don&#x27;t have access to the environmental variables needed to run the commands. 
On Windows App Services you can performance such connectivity and authentication troubleshooting by running¬†MSI Validator, but on Linux App Services we need to leverage the WebSSH functionality to troubleshoot.
So, to address below you can find a list of commands to test connectivity and access to Azure SQL Server Database on Linux App Services.¬†
Connectivity troubleshooting steps
We would need to follow the 4 steps mentioned below to test the connectivity:

In case of a disconnection, you might run into common errors such as &quot;Azure Functions runtime is unreachable&quot;. Fortunately, Microsoft has a helpful guide to address this issue, which provides self-help troubleshooting steps for recovering your storage account in case of such errors. You can check it out here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-recover-storage-account.

Previously, the only way to grant the permission for an Azure Function to access its runtime in a storage account was via the connection string in &quot;azurewebjobsstorage&quot; configuration. However, a new and more secure approach exists for grant‚Ä¶</a>

It‚Äôs been another busy year and I‚Äôm as aware as ever of the challenge of keeping all of my habits and outputs going. Some, like reading, are easy to maintain, but others, like writing, long-term projects, recording music, require focus and dedicated time that can be hard to track down. But I‚Äôll keep fighting to keep these habits alive, always wary of prioritizing the mundane and waking up five years later having produced nothing really that useful.

In the last article about WP Multisite: How to setup Subdirectory Multisite in WordPress on Azure App Service - Microsoft Community Hub, we discussed about what WordPress multisite is and how we can set up multisite in WordPress on App Service using the sub directory style. In this article, we will learn about how we can set up subdomain style multisite.
WordPress Multisite ‚Äì quick recap
WordPress Multisite is a feature of WordPress that enables you to run, manage and administer multiple WordPress websites from a single WordPress installation. You could update multiple websites in a single click by using the parent WordPress dashboard, and even manage individual sites through their individual dashboards. This feature was previously called WordPress Mu‚Ä¶</a>

Once you set up a new WordPress website on App Service, you can access your website using the URL .azurewebsites.net. Custom Domains are domain names that reflect your brand or company. For example, microsoft.com is the custom domain used by Microsoft for their website. In this article, we will learn about how we can use Custom Domains and subdomains with our WordPress website on App Service.
¬†
You can buy an App Service domain and use it with your WordPress website. App Service Domains are custom domains that are managed directly in Azure. Also, if you have an existing custom domain registered with any other registrar, you can use that with your WordPress website as well.

A cipher suite is a set of instructions that contains algorithms and protocols to help secure network connections between clients and servers. By default, the front-end‚Äôs OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end‚Äôs OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.
App Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

Why host apps in Windows Containers on Azure App Service?
Customers choose to deploy applications in Windows Containers for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:

Company policy ‚Äì some customers require all applications to be deployed as containers for policy and consistency requirements.
Applications with dependencies ‚Äì deploying an application in a Windows Container enables developers to bring along dependencies such as custom‚Ä¶</a>

              How to increase concurrency on python function app hosted in app service plan?
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9799 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-increase-concurrency-on-python-function-app-hosted-in-app/ba-p/3882010>There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.
¬†

Based on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.
¬†
Lab1:
code:
sync

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT&#x3D;1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT&#x3D;1
Result:
It took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.

Lab2:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT&#x3D;1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT&#x3D;2
Result:
It took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

¬†
Lab3:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT&#x3D;2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT&#x3D;2
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

Lab4:
code:
async

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT&#x3D;1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT&#x3D;1
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

¬†
Conclusion:
1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing¬†FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and¬†PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency.¬†
2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.
