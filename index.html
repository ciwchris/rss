The symptom might include that after restarting the web app for a few hours, a percentage of the total requests (e.g. 1/3) get no response from the web server and timeout after 230 seconds. 230 seconds is the Azure default timeout value. The web app&#x27;s memory usage may be observed to grow continuously since the issue starts.¬†

The default MAX concurrent session setting of WCF server is 5000. If the WCF clients don‚Äôt close channels¬† properly, a lot of sessions which have been completed will not be able to get closed at the WCF s‚Ä¶</a>

Your customers might challenging you by exposing the inter-connection among resources under public networks. For example, You builded a Function App for tracking customers&#x27; information and storing them in to a Blob container (from a Storage Account). Meanwhile, connections invoked by that function uses public domain name to the container, which means those requests might have a great opportunity routing outside.

It came down to a question of whether the things I thought should be priorities were actually the priorities. I had a backlog that could easily have stretched a few more weeks into the future, and by the time I was done with those tasks I probably would have found some more that seemed like a priority. But there‚Äôs a real danger of going too far down the wrong road with these things.
What I learned was a great mix of confirmations - that what I‚Äôm building is useful - and surprises, about what‚Äôs important and what troubles people run into.

              Simplify Azure Container Apps deployments with &quot;az containerapp up&quot;

It can be a cumbersome process to build a container image, push it to a registry, and then set up infrastructure and deploy the container.
¬†
Azure Container Apps is a modern, fully-managed, serverless platform for running containers. While we don&#x27;t have to manage infrastructure, it&#x27;s still up to us to figure out how to build our container image and deploy it.
¬†
Today, we&#x27;re introducing a preview feature in the Azure CLI that streamlines the process of deploying to Azure Container Apps in a single command. Whether your source code is on your local machine or in GitHub, &quot;az containerapp up&quot; is the only command you need to get your app running in Azure Container Apps.
¬†
How does it work?

¬†
First, what is GitOps? Is it the same as DevOps? I&#x27;m so glad you asked. Let&#x27;s begin with a refresher on what DevOps is:
¬†
&quot;DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users.&quot; ~ Donovan Brown
¬†
Donovan puts it best - DevOps is a combination of several key factors: people, process, and products - but it starts with people. Getting started with DevOps involves a cultural shift, which means it&#x27;s so much more than buzz words like agile, continuous integration, continuous deployment, automation, etc. While those buzz words have their place and are needed, truly embracing DevOps means creating a DevOps culture between your engineering teams - this includes developers, operations, security, and beyond.

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

Azure Spring Cloud platform provides AppPlatformIngressLogs to query Ingress request log for those Apps with endpoint enabled.
But for the Apps with endpoint disabled, since the traffic is not going through the platform load balancer, the ingress request log is not recorded. For such cases, to monitor the App access log, we can use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like Application Insights.

In this blog, let&#x27;s demonstrate how to use AppPlatformIngressLogs and Application Insights to monitor both types of request access log.

Three slices of bread or one teaspoon of table salt will do it, and chances are your daily sodium intake is far greater. More than 90% of Americans consume too much sodium, which can lead to hypertension, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease and stroke.

The identity is managed by the Azure platform and does not require you to provision or rotate any secrets.
We have two types of Managed Identities:

System-assigned Identity
User-assigned Identity

You can read about Managed Identity for App Service and Azure Functions here.
Below are the steps for the configuration:

You can create an App Service or an Azure Function and use the code example below to retrieve the token using the Azure Identity client library via System-assigned identity:

              Add a Default Error Page in web.xml for Java app in Windows App Service
              <span class="post-metadata">(3 min | 891 words)</span> 
            </summary>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/add-a-default-error-page-in-web-xml-for-java-app-in-windows-app/ba-p/3286691>App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.
¬†
Before talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let&#x27;s discuss &quot;what is web.xml&quot;?
¬†
Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named¬†web.xml and resides in the app&#x27;s WAR under the¬†WEB-INF/¬†directory.¬†web.xml¬†is part of the servlet standard for web applications.
¬†
The default¬†Servlet configurations is under¬†${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under¬†${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.
¬†
When tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application.¬†
¬†
It instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.
There you specify:

what servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to
listeners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)
configuration parameters (context-params)
error pages, welcome files
security constraints

Back to our topic, if you haven&#x27;t defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:

¬†
To add a custom error page, please follow below steps:

Add  in web.xml under¬†webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page &quot;error.html&quot; is under root folder /webapp, so I should use &quot;/error.html&quot; in .



Add your custom error in webapps folder.



Build and re-deploy the project to App Service.
Now you will see the custom error page replace the default one.


¬†
Please kindly note, configurations won&#x27;t take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.</a>

They teased a dashcam hardware in 2020, and announced the crypto angle in 2022.
The idea of individuals contributing streetview-like imagery with a dashcam is not new. Mapillary did exactly that starting in 2013, established a large dataset and active community in a few years, and sold to Facebook in 2020.
What follows is a quick review of what is currently available about Hivemapper‚Äôs new phase:

The App Service VNet integration feature enables your apps to access resources in or through a virtual network but doesn&#x27;t grant inbound private access to your apps. For inbound access, you need private endpoints, which allow clients located in your private network to securely access your apps over Private Link, which eliminates exposure from the public internet.

With this update, you can use our lower-cost tiers and achieve the same level of security that you could previously only achieve with our high-end SKUs.

NAFLD can lead to permanent liver damage, and heart disease is the leading cause of death in people with fatty liver disease. Because NAFLD is often missed in routine medical screening, the new scientific statement raises awareness and understanding about its link to heart disease and to outline how to prevent and diagnose the condition.</a>

Sometimes the application may encounter network connection issue for different reasons. If we can run DNS resolve and TCP ping test from inside the Azure Spring Cloud to the outside target, it should be helpful for us to quickly narrow down network connection related issues.

Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re building a microservices architecture. It typically consists of an API gateway and many API apps, which are Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Functions API in this example. The microservices architecture might be more complex depending on the requirements, but it&#x27;s way too far from our topic. Therefore, let&#x27;s build a minimal structure that is working.

The results showed that total fiber, and more specifically cereal fiber but not fruit or vegetable fiber, was consistently associated with lower inflammation and lower CVD incidence. Until now there had been limited data on the link between fiber and inflammation among older adults, who have higher levels of inflammation compared with younger adults.</a>

The charts are the result of a research project spanning six continents and bringing together possibly the largest ever MRI datasets ever aggregated -- almost 125,000 brain scans from over a 100 different studies. Although not currently intended for clinical use, the team hopes the charts will become a routine clinical tool similar to how standardised paediatric growth charts are used.</a>
