                    <span>As some of you may have read over the past days, there has been an ownership dispute over the freenode.net network. The IRC network has been used by Arch Linux and many other projects over the past decades as a platform for discussion and support.
The dispute led to the exodus of most former freenode staff from the network and the founding of a new network: libera.chat
Starting today, Arch Linux and its sister projects Arch Linux ARM and Arch Linux 32 will begin migrating the official IRC channels from freenode.net to libera.chat. Please bear with us as this can take some time to be fully settled in.
We thank the freenode community for the many years of great service and collaboration.</span>

                    <span>When a single gene in a cell is turned on or off, its resulting presence or absence can affect the function and survival of the cell. Researchers have now successfully catalogued this effect in the human neuron by separately toggling each of the 20,000 genes in the human genome.</span>

                    <span>One of the first studies to examine telomere length (TL) in childhood finds that the initial setting of TL during prenatal development and in the first years of life may determine one&#x27;s TL throughout childhood and potentially even into adulthood or older age. The study also finds that TL decreases most rapidly from birth to age 3, followed by a period of maintenance into the pre-puberty period, although it was sometimes seen to lengthen.</span>

                    <span>The nerve cells, also called neurons, in our brain control all the basic processes of our body. For this reason, there are different types of neurons distributed over specific regions of the brain. Researchers have now developed an approach that allows them to show that neurons that are supposedly the same are actually very different: they not only sense different hormones for the body&#x27;s energy state, but also have a different influence on food intake. This can have a direct effect on our metabolism, for ex…</span>

                    <span>While it has been said that the eyes are a window to the soul, a new study shows they could be a means for understanding diseases of the brain. According to new research, retinal scans can detect key changes in blood vessels that may provide an early sign of Alzheimer&#x27;s, while offering important insights into how one of the most common Alzheimer&#x27;s risk genes contributes to the disease.</span>

                    <span>Why we dream is a divisive topic within the scientific community, and the neuroscience field is saturated with hypotheses. Inspired by techniques used to train deep neural networks, a neuroscience researcher argues for a new theory of dreams: the overfitted brain hypothesis. The hypothesis suggests that the strangeness of our dreams serves to help our brains better generalize our day-to-day experiences.</span>

                    <span>Researchers have uncovered molecular clues that help explain what makes some neurons more susceptible than others in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The scientists present evidence that neurons with high levels of the protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) are more sensitive to degeneration, and that this susceptibility is linked to apoE&#x27;s regulation of immune-response molecules within neurons.</span>

Running around the Embarcadero in the heat, and running to the ocean via Golden Gate Park, where that last leg of JFK Drive gets chilly because of the sea breeze. Eleva…</span>

                    <span>Using naturalistic driving data and machine learning techniques, researchers have developed highly accurate algorithms for detecting mild cognitive impairment and dementia in older drivers. Naturalistic driving data refer to data captured through in-vehicle recording devices or other technologies in the real-world setting. These data could be processed to measure driving exposure, space and performance in great detail.</span>

The final maturation stage is critical for reproduction because it provides the material early embryos need to develop normally and survive. The researchers also found that abnormal BMI also impacted oocyte development, but through different root mechanisms compared to the fertility decline caused by age.</span>

                    <span>Despite the prevalence of Alzheimer&#x27;s, there are still no treatments, in part because it has been challenging to study how the disease develops. Now, scientists have uncovered new insights into what goes awry during Alzheimer&#x27;s by growing neurons that resemble -- more accurately than ever before -- brain cells in older patients. And like patients themselves, the afflicted neurons appear to lose their cellular identity.</span>
