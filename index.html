According to researchers, people who develop this condition are also three times more likely to be involved in a vehicle accident.</span>

                      <span>Researchers examined a subset of GABA neurons in the circadian rhythm control center within the hypothalamus of the brain. They eliminated GABA signaling of vasopressin-producing neurons only in mice and found that it impaired circadian behavior. Specifically, time spent being active increased every day. Analysis showed a timing mismatch between the center's molecular clock and the behavior. Thus, GABA signaling is required to make sure the timing remains in sync.</span>

Naturalistic driving data refer to data captured through in-vehicle recording devices or other technologies in the real-world setting.

                      <span>Despite the prevalence of Alzheimer's, there are still no treatments, in part because it has been challenging to study how the disease develops. Now, scientists have uncovered new insights into what goes awry during Alzheimer's by growing neurons that resemble -- more accurately than ever before -- brain cells in older patients. And like patients themselves, the afflicted neurons appear to lose their cellular identity.</span>

                      <span>Employees' cafeteria purchases -- both healthy and unhealthy foods -- were influenced by their co-workers' food choices, found a large, two-year study of hospital employees. The study made innovative use of cash register data to gain insights into how individuals' social networks shape their health behavior. The research suggests we might structure future efforts aimed at improving population health by capitalizing on how one person's behavior influences another.</span>
