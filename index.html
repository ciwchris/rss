In this blog post, we‚Äôll cover how App Service users can navigate to Azure Load Testing amidst diagnosing performance bottlenecks.
¬†
Azure Load Testing is a fully managed load testing service that enables you to easily generate large-scale load. It provides actionable insights that can help identify performance, scalability and capacity issues. Azure customers can monitor their applications in Azure Load Testing during the load simulation to analyze the consumption of their resources.

Azure App Service helps you build and host web apps, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs in any programming language. However, it‚Äôs prudent to be prepared for any potentia‚Ä¶</a>

Below are few experiments with different configurations of Gunicorn.¬†
¬†

Create Python Flask App that sleeps for two seconds and responds with message &#x27;Finished&#x27;. This is to effectively mimic application making an outbound HTTP call or database call.
from flask import Flask
import time

app &#x3D; Flask(__name__)

@app.route(&#x27;/&#x27;)
def hello_world():
    time.sleep(2)
    return &quot;Finished&quot;

if __name__ &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;__main__&#x27;:
    app.run()‚Äã

Create script with 5 threads which will make 5 simultaneous HTTP calls to this Flask API.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/08/29/an-open-core.html>A few weeks ago, HashiCorp switched its default license for future product releases to the BSL license. The BSL license was created by the people at MariaDB in 2017 to give companies a way to release software as open source but prohibit their competitors from re-hosting that software and competing with them. In HashiCorp‚Äôs case, the license also has a stipulation that their code becomes simply liberally open source under the MPL, four years after it‚Äôs published under the BSL.
This prompted the usual outcry from the open source community, and some intelligent analysis. For the legal license analysis, you can do no better than reading Kyle E. Mitchell‚Äôs article and his summary of the strategy and list of the implementations at duallicensing.com.

You can make these tasks happen whenever you want, following a schedule, or when something specific occurs. These jobs work well for things like dealing with data, teaching computers, or situations where you need quick computing power without leaving a trace.

This blog helps you in deploying an event driven job using Azure Container apps and Azure Service Bus. In this example, the trigger will be a message in Service bus Queue and the Azure container app Job reads the message present in the queue and prints the message in container app console log.

Below are the steps to be performed:

By default, PHP version is getting displayed as in the below screenshot-

¬†
¬†Updating PHP Settings-

Go to your KUDU site https://.scm.azurewebsites.net.
Select Bash or SSH from the top menu.
In Bash/SSH, go to your &quot;/home/site&quot; directory.
Create a directory called &quot;ini&quot; (i.e. mkdir ini)
Change directories to &quot;ini&quot;.
We&#x27;ll need to create an &quot;ini&quot; file to add our settings to.¬† In this example, I&#x27;m using &quot;settings.ini&quot;.¬† There are no file editors such as Vi, Vim, or Nano so we&#x27;ll simply use echo to add the settings to the file.¬† I&#x27;m changing the expose_php setting to Off.¬† Below is the command that I used to add the setting and create an &quot;settings.ini&quot; file if one doesn&#x27;t already exist.

¬†NOTE:¬† If you already have an extensions.ini file, you can use the same command which will add the new setting to the file.¬†
/home/site/ini&gt;echo¬†&quot; expose_php &#x3D; Off &quot;¬†&gt;&gt;¬†settings.ini
If using SSH, you can use vi to create/edit the settings file using the following commands.

¬†vi settings.ini
¬†Press &quot;i&quot; on your keyboard to start editing and add the following.

¬†expose_php &#x3D; Off¬† 
3.¬†Press &quot;Esc&quot;, then &quot;:wq!&quot; and enter to save.
Add an Application Setting-
We&#x27;ll now need to go to the Azure Portal and add an Application Setting to scan the &quot;ini&quot; directory
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 1) Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and select your App Service Linux PHP application.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 2) Select Application Settings for the app.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 3) Under the Application settings section, press the &quot;+ Add new setting&quot;.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 4) For the App Setting Name, enter &quot;PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR&quot;. For the value, enter &quot;/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini&quot;

Go to kudu site and run the command below and you can verify that PHP header is removed.

At times though, these downstream services are isolated within a virtual network, preventing access from Static Web Apps‚Äô managed Azure Functions.

This guide is to help you troubleshoot Azure SQL connectivity and authentication issues on Linux App Services.
Note:¬†At the time of writing this cannot be executed in Linux Function Apps, since we don&#x27;t have access to the environmental variables needed to run the commands. 
On Windows App Services you can performance such connectivity and authentication troubleshooting by running¬†MSI Validator, but on Linux App Services we need to leverage the WebSSH functionality to troubleshoot.
So, to address below you can find a list of commands to test connectivity and access to Azure SQL Server Database on Linux App Services.¬†
Connectivity troubleshooting steps
We would need to follow the 4 steps mentioned below to test the connectivity:

In case of a disconnection, you might run into common errors such as &quot;Azure Functions runtime is unreachable&quot;. Fortunately, Microsoft has a helpful guide to address this issue, which provides self-help troubleshooting steps for recovering your storage account in case of such errors. You can check it out here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-recover-storage-account.

Previously, the only way to grant the permission for an Azure Function to access its runtime in a storage account was via the connection string in &quot;azurewebjobsstorage&quot; configuration. However, a new and more secure approach exists for grant‚Ä¶</a>
