Why we use it
This tutorial will introduce how to integrate Microsoft Entra with Azure SQL Server to avoid using fixed usernames and passwords. By utilizing user-assigned managed identities as a programmatic bridge, it becomes easier for Azure-related PaaS services (such as Function App or App Services) to communicate with the database without storing connection information in plain text.

Architecture

I will introduce each service or component and their configurations in subsequent chapters according to the order of A-D:
A: The company&#x27;s account administrator needs to create or designate a user as the database administrator. This role can only be assigned to one person within the database and is responsible for basic configuratio‚Ä¶</a>

In preparation for the next steps for Kagi, we&#x27;re launching a new Discord server where we will consolidate both of our communities for Search, Orion, and all future Kagi products.
Join here: https://kagi.com/discord
We welcome everyone, whether you are a long standing supporter or just learning about Kagi, to come hang out with us and get excited about what&#x27;s coming next.
The existing servers will be sunset over the course of the following week.
See you there!

Well maybe you did, but I certainly didn‚Äôt. Whenever someone talks about any type of AI-based application, they&#x27;re almost always talking about Python. So, it was a welcome surprise for me to discover it since I&#x27;m way more familiar with Node than Python.

I decided to give the Node SDK a go just to see how well it works and stumbled upon a great cookbook tutorial by OpenAI. I took most of the code from that sample as-is, wrote a static front-end chat client for it, and then wired it up as a sample space called ‚ÄúActivity Planner Agent‚Äù that you can easily deploy in App Spaces.¬† The only prerequisite is that you‚Äôll need an OpenAI API key, which we‚Äôll walk through below.

What is it
Azure Web Apps or Azure Function Apps frequently communicate with Application Insights to log various levels of data, which can later be reviewed and filtered in the Log Analytics Workspace.

Why the change?
Nearly three years ago, Azure announced that to‚ÄØcontinue to use your cloud services that were deployed using Cloud Services (classic), you must migrate them to Cloud Services (extended support)‚ÄØin Resource Manager before 31 August 2024.‚ÄØSince then, thousands of customers have taken advantage of the tools and resources from Microsoft to successfully complete the migration.¬†Beginning 1st September 2024, any remaining Cloud Service deployments would be stopped and deallocated, and data will be permanently lost. ¬†

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/app-spaces-simplifying-application-logging/ba-p/4179170>In today&#x27;s fast-paced development environment, having an efficient and seamless logging system is crucial for maintaining and debugging applications. App Spaces is a new experience which does things a bit differently from what‚Äôs common in Azure today.¬† It brings different logging systems together to form a seamless end-to-end experience so that you can start producing and monitoring your application easily.
¬†
First, what is App Spaces?
App Spaces is a new experience which is designed to simplify the process of building end-to-end applications in Azure. Here‚Äôs how it stands out:

              Memory Dump Collection using Procdump.exe for App Service (Windows)
              <span class="post-metadata">(29 min | 8717 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/memory-dump-collection-using-procdump-exe-for-app-service/ba-p/4185635>A memory dump is a snapshot of the contents of a computer&#x27;s volatile memory (RAM) stored for analysis or debugging purposes.¬† ProcDump is a command-line tool designed to monitor applications for CPU/Memory spikes and generate crash dumps when spikes occur. Administrators or developers can then use these dumps to pinpoint the cause of the spikes. This guide will walk you through collecting a memory dump using Procdump.exe for applications hosted on App Service (Windows).
¬†

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Click on &quot;Advanced Tools&quot; and then &quot;Go -&gt;&quot; to access the SCM/Kudu site.


¬†

On the SCM site, go to Process Explorer to find the PID of the w3wp.exe process, which is the application worker process.


¬†

Use the Debug console to open the CMD option.


¬†

Navigate to the System Drive and access the sysinternals path:

C:\devtools\sysinternals&gt;
Note: The drive letter may vary (e.g., D:\ or C:)



¬†

Locate the procdump.exe file in the sysinternals directory, which will be used for running commands.
To collect logs for the application worker process, use the PID obtained earlier.
Use the following command to collect a full memory dump.

Procdump.exe -accepteula -ma [PID] [Path]

Path:¬†Specifies the directory where the collected memory dump file will be stored.


Example: procdump.exe -accepteula -ma 5100 C:\dumps\



¬†

Initiate the dump collection and reproduce the issue the application is facing.


¬†

After the memory dump collection is complete, access the specific path on the SCM site to download the collected memory dump.



¬†
You can consult the following article for further details on Procdump commands and various parameters to utilize depending on your specific needs and troubleshooting scenario.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump
¬†
It&#x27;s advisable to gather multiple sets of memory dumps because analyzing several dumps can reveal patterns and facilitate the development of an action plan to resolve issues effectively.</a>

It also provides guidance on how to review these collected traces to pinpoint the root cause and take steps towards resolving it.
¬†

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Navigate to &quot;Diagnose and Solve Problems&quot; -&gt; &quot;Diagnostic Tools&quot;


¬†

Choose &quot;Collect .NET Profiler Trace&quot; option.
Configure the trace options to gather data from the specific application instance, including thread details.


¬†

Reproduce the issue at step 2.


¬†

Access and examine the generated report.


¬†

In the demo application, a delay of approximately 20 seconds was observed. Refer to the browser network traces provided below.


¬†

Analyze the profiler traces to pinpoint the cause of the reported delay.


¬†

After examining the demo app&#x27;s code, it was evident that a deliberate 20-second delay was introduced in the Privacy method within the Home Controller.


¬†

Note: Default profiler log collection time is 60 seconds and it is possible to increase the default profiling duration by setting an application setting IIS_PROFILING_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS with a maximum value of 900 (i.e. 15 minutes).</a>
