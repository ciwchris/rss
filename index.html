                    <span>Lab animals deficient in vitamin D crave and become dependent on opioids, which is curbed when normal levels of the vitamin are restored. Human health records indicate that people with low vitamin D are more likely to use and misuse opioids. Study results suggest a potential role for vitamin D supplementation in fighting opioid addiction.</span>

They report high levels of cis P-tau, a pathogenic protein, in human AD and VaD brains as well as preclinical disease models.

                    <span>Nerve cells of the vagus nerve fulfill opposing tasks. The gut and the brain communicate with each other in order to adapt satiety and blood sugar levels during food consumption. The vagus nerve is an important communicator between these two organs. Researchers now took a closer look at the functions of the different nerve cells in the control center of the vagus nerve, and discovered something very surprising: although the nerve cells are located in the same control center, they innervate different regions of the gut and also differentially control satiety and blood sugar levels. This discovery could play an important role in the development of future therapeutic strategies against obesity and diabetes.</span>

                    <span>This was a big month. May 1 feels like eons ago. I’m in a different
place (New York). The
situation with COVID feels dramatically different. Acquired a few new
gray hairs due to the absolute horror which is the logistics of moving
cross-country, especially during a pandemic. We spent a few nervous weeks
waiting for furniture to arrive, and dreading the next interaction with our
absolutely-terrible-no-good moving company. When VCs and some tech company
‘disrupt’ moving by undercutting and technologizing movers, I will make
an exception and cheer them on: this industry deserves to end.
But then, seeing so many old faces, reconnecting, finding a new
favorite restaurant and bar every few days. Visiting family. Feeling some optimism
about the general future.

Scientists have found that the targeting the protein called FK506-binding protein 51 or FKBP51 promotes the clearing of those toxic proteins via autophagy, a natural process whereby cells recycle damaged proteins and mitochondria and use them for nutrition.</span>

                    <span>Evidence of sleep-dependent low-frequency (less than 0.1 Hz) global brain activity in the clearance of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease-related toxin buildup is presented in new research. This neuronal activity was more strongly linked with cerebrospinal fluid flow in healthy controls than higher risk groups and patients, and the findings could serve as a potential imaging marker for clinicians in evaluating patients.</span>

Researchers find a link between chronotype and amount of sleep shift workers can get with their irregular schedules.</span>

                    <span>Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is the main cause of dementia and current therapeutic strategies cannot prevent, slow down or cure the pathology. The disease is characterized by memory loss, caused by the degeneration and death of neuronal cells in several regions of the brain, including the hippocampus. Researchers have identified a small molecule that can be used to rejuvenate the brain and counteract the memory loss.</span>

                    <span>Patients who suffer from REM sleep behavior disorder have altered blood flow in the brain, which can lead to a lack of oxygen in the brain tissue. In the long term, this may cause symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.</span>

                    <span>While we sleep, the brain produces particular activation patterns. When two of these patterns - slow oscillations and sleep spindles - gear into each other, previous experiences are reactivated. The stronger the reactivation, the clearer will be our recall of past events, a new study reveals.</span>

                    <span>As some of you may have read over the past days, there has been an ownership dispute over the freenode.net network. The IRC network has been used by Arch Linux and many other projects over the past decades as a platform for discussion and support.
The dispute led to the exodus of most former freenode staff from the network and the founding of a new network: libera.chat
Starting today, Arch Linux and its sister projects Arch Linux ARM and Arch Linux 32 will begin migrating the official IRC channels from freenode.net to libera.chat. Please bear with us as this can take some time to be fully settled in.
We thank the freenode community for the many years of great service and collaboration.</span>

                    <span>The nerve cells, also called neurons, in our brain control all the basic processes of our body. For this reason, there are different types of neurons distributed over specific regions of the brain. Researchers have now developed an approach that allows them to show that neurons that are supposedly the same are actually very different: they not only sense different hormones for the body&#x27;s energy state, but also have a different influence on food intake. This can have a direct effect on our metabolism, for ex…</span>

                    <span>The development of dementia late in life is associated with abnormal blood levels of dozens of proteins up to five years earlier, according to a new study. Most of these proteins were not known to be linked to dementia before, suggesting new targets for prevention therapies.</span>
