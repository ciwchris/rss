Now, let&#x27;s slightly move the focus to Azure Functions app. How can you containerise the Azure Functions app? Fortunately, Azure Functions Core Tools natively support it with Dockerfile. But is the Dockerfile the only option for containerising your .NET-based Azure Functions apps? Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how Azure Functions apps can be containerised both with and without Dockerfile.

You can find a sample code from this GitHub repository.

Prerequisites

There are a few prerequisites to containerise .NET-based function apps effectively.

.NET SDK 8.0+
Azure Functions Core Tools
Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code + C# Dev Kit + Azure Functions
Docker Desktop

We are excited to announce two significant enhancements to ARO&#x27;s capabilities:

The ability to configure multiple IP addresses per cluster load balancer is now generally available.
ARO clusters can now scale up to 250 worker nodes.

Previously, ARO clusters were limited to 62 worker nodes due to having only one IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with the cluster&#x27;s load balancer. By enabling multiple IP addresses for the load balancer, we have removed this bottleneck, offering organizations greater flexibility in expanding their deployments.

HTTP Server and Startup Script
Azure Web App (App Service) exposes ports 80/443, with 443 being the encrypted port commonly used. This means that regardless of which port your locally developed application listens to, you need to perform port forwarding when deploying to the Web App.

What is MQTT?¬†
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight, pub/sub messaging protocol designed specifically for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. It&#x27;s an ideal choice for IoT (Internet of Things) devices and other scenarios where resources are limited. Development teams even build chat apps using MQTT protocol. ¬†

WebJobs are a feature of Azure App Service that allows you to run background tasks or scripts in your App Service. They are particularly useful for executing jobs such as scheduled tasks, data processing, or background maintenance tasks. WebJobs can run continuously, on-demand, or on a scheduled basis, and they can be written in various programming languages.
The goal of this blog post is to guide you through the process of setting up and deploying a WebJob on an Azure App Service running Linux. We will walk you through the necessary steps to create and deploy a WebJob, configure its settings, and manage it effectively. By the end of this blog, you will have a working WebJob integrated into your Azure App Service, capable of performing background tasks or processing jobs as ne‚Ä¶</a>

For the workload profile container app, private link support is not yet available. This is because the ‚ÄúPrivate Link Service does not support a load balancer that has an IP-based backend pool, which is used in Consumption + Dedicated environments (Workload Profile)‚Äù. Although we have a roadmap to implement this feature (Private link support for Workload Profiles ¬∑ Azure Container Apps Roadmap), there is currently no ETA.
¬†
In the meantime, I will guide you on how to integrate a workload profile container app with Azure Front Door using an Application Gateway. The architecture involves using the Application Gateway private link to connect to the Front Door, and placing the Application Gateway in the same VNET as the container app to achieve this integration.

35% of all exposed API keys are still active - 35% of exposed API keys still active, posing major security risks - Help Net Security


That&#x27;s a pretty scary statement, that means services are being misused most likely, data is actively being stolen and so on. 

Let&#x27;s try to understand why the concept of API keys is a problematic one and how we can move away from it.

This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won&#x27;t know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.
¬†
In this post, we&#x27;ll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We&#x27;ll create a simple API that implements the¬†Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job. This approach provides a much more robust and scalable solution for long-running tasks.

Starting August 1st, Azure Container Registry (ACR) will update its behavior regarding the deletion and re-creation of registries. ACR will prevent the reuse of a subdomain name, e.g. abc123.azurecr.io, for a period after the resource is deleted. This updated behavior enhances security and prevents subdomain takeovers by automatically reserving registry names during the creation of the ACR resource, without requiring any additional action or configuration from customers.¬†

Once a resource name is reserved, it remains reserved from the moment of creation and throughout an extended period following the deletion of the resource (referred to as a cooldown period). During this cooldown period, subscriptions not associated with the original Azure AD tenant that created the reso‚Ä¶</a>

Introduction
Vector image search uses AI to revolutionize how we find and retrieve images. This article explains how to combine Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search for an efficient solution. We&#x27;ll cover setup, deployment, and usage to guide AI developers and engineers. We&#x27;ll focus on the search and vectorize methods in the function_app.py Python file, crucial for integrating Azure&#x27;s AI services for vector image searches. This technology is ideal for applications like e-commerce and digital asset management.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220429145059.htm>Scientists pinpoint the molecular epicenter of deep-sleep regulation. The findings, based on research in mice, identify a gene that makes a protein that regulates delta waves -- electrical signals between neurons that occur during the deepest phases of relaxation and are a hallmark of restorative sleep.</a>
