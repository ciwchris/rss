              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/libxml22912-6-update-may-require-manual-intervention/>The libxml2 package prior to version 2.9.12-6 was missing the compiled python modules. This has been fixed in 2.9.12-6, so the upgrade may need to overwrite any untracked pyc files created. If you get errors like these
libxml2: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/drv_libxml2.cpython-310.opt-1.pyc exists in filesystem
libxml2: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/drv_libxml2.cpython-310.pyc exists in filesystem
libxml2: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/libxml2.cpython-310.opt-1.pyc exists in filesystem
libxml2: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/libxml2.cpython-310.pyc exists in filesystem

when updating, use
pacman -Syu --overwrite /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/\*

to perform the upgrade.</a>

It might also be possible to have heard of or currently use oh-my-posh for your PowerShell. Azure offers Azure Cloud Shell service, which uses both Bash Shell and PowerShell by default. Therefore, if you want either oh-my-zsh or oh-my-posh, or both, you should configure it by yourself.
¬†
Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to show how to configure your shell environment for both.
¬†

This GitHub repository provides the working shell script source for your reference.

¬†
For oh-my-zsh
¬†
Let&#x27;s configure oh-my-zsh on your Azure Cloud Shell. Make sure that you see the Bash Shell prompt. If not, enter the bash command to switch your prompt to Bash.
¬†


Install oh-my-zsh.

However, a large new study does not show a relationship between high intake of gluten and increased IBS symptoms. The researchers did find that a certain type of carbohydrate called &#x27;fodmaps&#x27; can aggravate intestinal problems, however, the overall results indicate that they also have less influence than previously thought.</a>

The combination not only decreased arthritis inflammation markers in the cells but improved the production of desired proteins normally found in healthy cartilage. While still at an early stage, the findings suggest a new procedure could be developed to treat cartilage cells extracted from a patient to grow a supply of cells or a tissue to be re-implanted.</a>

Note that¬†Azure Active Directory managed identity authentication method was added in ODBC Driver since version 17.3.1.1 for both system-assigned and user-assigned identities. In Azure blessed image for Python Function, the ODBC Driver version is 17.8. Which makes it possible to leverage this feature in Linux App Service.

Briefly, this post will provide you a step to step guidance with sample code and introduction on the authentication‚Ä¶</a>

You can secure communications end-to-end or terminate transport-level security at any communication point for Spring Boot apps. You can also automate the provisioning and configuration for all the Azure resources needed for securing communications.

Implementing secure communications as part of your solution architecture can be challenging. Many customers manually rotate their certificates or create their own solutions to automate provisioning and configuration. Even then, there is still data exfiltration risk ‚Äì say unauthorized copying or transfer of data from server systems. With Azure Spring Cloud, all of this is handled ‚Ä¶</a>

In a new study, Yale researchers used one such clock, appropriately named &quot;GrimAge,&quot; to ask two questions: How much does chronic stress accelerate that biological clock?

Practically every photo I‚Äôd license as CC-BY-SA. If someone used one of my photos in their blog, I felt a little jolt of approval and recognition. It felt cool.

              Refactoring Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions is also suitable for building CI/CD pipelines. But, compared to Azure DevOps, there are many spaces to achieve the same efficiency level as Azure DevOps. GitHub Actions has recently released a new feature called &quot;Reusable Workflows&quot;, which you can reduce the refactoring concerns. Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to refactor the existing Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD pipeline workflows, using the &quot;reusable workflows&quot; feature of GitHub Actions.

Workflow for Azure Static Web Apps
¬†
While provisioning an Azure Static Web Apps (ASWA) instance, GitHub Actions workflow is automatically generated by default. Here&#x27;s a sample workflow. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not that different from yours.

The traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because the market is ‚Äúefficient‚Äù (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.
Coase noted, however, that there are a number of transaction costs to using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is actually more than just the price of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentia‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
Kubernetes has become a platform of choice for building cloud native applications. Kubernetes is highly scalable, highly available, and easy to use, and has many other advantages that make it an excellent choice for building distributed applications.
¬†
However, its distributed nature means monitoring everything that is happening within the cluster can be a challenge. Prometheus and Grafana make our experience better.
¬†
In this article, we will set up a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and deploy Prometheus and Grafana to gather monitoring data and visualize them.
¬†
Understand the tooling

Prometheus is an open source project that was originally created at SoundCloud in 2012, and contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation‚Ä¶</a>
