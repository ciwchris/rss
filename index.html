Mood and behavioral symptoms were measured along with cognition using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Intervention with this robotic cat improved all mood scores over time, with significant improvements in mood and depression. More than half of the participants scored higher on the MMSE post-test than pretest, with slight to moderate improvement in attention/calculation, language, and registration. The robotic cats also provided participants with an alternative way to express themselves.</a>

Now, using a mouse model of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, researchers have shown that the intake of a specific set of amino acids can inhibit the death of brain cells, protect the connections between them, and reduce inflammation, preserving brain function. Their research suggests that this amino acid combination called Amino LP7 can hinder the development of dementia, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</a>

They noted a clear divergence in these bacterial communities in toddlers, which is typically before progressive lung disease takes hold in patients with CF. Their findings could help providers target specific pathogens earlier, treat them and potentially prevent more severe lung disease.</a>

Researchers have largely assumed that reduced food intake drove these benefits by reprogramming metabolism. But a new study finds that reduced calorie intake alone is not enough; fasting is essential for mice to derive full benefit.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/10/211013152103.htm>At the beginning of neurodegenerative disease, the immune cells of the brain -- the &#x27;microglia&#x27; -- take up glucose, a sugar molecule, to a much greater extent than hitherto assumed. These results are of great significance for the interpretation of brain scans depicting the distribution of glucose in the brain. Furthermore, such image-based data could potentially serve as a biomarker to non-invasively capture the response of microglia to therapeutic interventions in people with dementia.</a>

Milk&#x27;s sleep-enhancing properties are commonly ascribed to tryptophan, but scientists have also discovered a mixture of milk peptides, called casein tryptic hydrolysate (CTH), that relieves stress and enhances sleep. Now, researchers have identified specific peptides in CTH that might someday be used in new, natural sleep remedies.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/10/211011091258.htm>Researchers have identified molecules in the blood that can indicate impending dementia. Their findings are based on human studies and laboratory experiments. The biomarker is based on measuring levels of so-called microRNAs. According to the study data, microRNAs could potentially also be targets for dementia therapy.</a>

It is often assumed that feeling more negative will color people&#x27;s experience of emotional images and events in the environment around them. However, researchers found that while going 24 hours without sleep impacted study participants&#x27; mood, it did not change their performance on tests evaluating their ability to process emotional words and images.</a>

Scientists revealed how gut bacteria contribute to the progression of advanced prostate cancers and their resistance to hormone therapy -- by providing an alternative source of growth-promoting androgens, or male hormones. The findings, once further validated in the clinic, could provide new opportunities for the treatment of prostate cancer through manipulation of the microbiome.</a>

The drug, Axitinib, inhibits growth of new blood vessels in the brain -- a feature shared by both cancer tumors and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. This hallmark represents a new target for Alzheimer&#x27;s therapies.
