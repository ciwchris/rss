In the last article about WP Multisite: How to setup Subdirectory Multisite in WordPress on Azure App Service - Microsoft Community Hub, we discussed about what WordPress multisite is and how we can set up multisite in WordPress on App Service using the sub directory style. In this article, we will learn about how we can set up subdomain style multisite.
WordPress Multisite ‚Äì quick recap
WordPress Multisite is a feature of WordPress that enables you to run, manage and administer multiple WordPress websites from a single WordPress installation. You could update multiple websites in a single click by using the parent WordPress dashboard, and even manage individual sites through their individual dashboards. This feature was previously called WordPress Mu‚Ä¶</a>

Once you set up a new WordPress website on App Service, you can access your website using the URL .azurewebsites.net. Custom Domains are domain names that reflect your brand or company. For example, microsoft.com is the custom domain used by Microsoft for their website. In this article, we will learn about how we can use Custom Domains and subdomains with our WordPress website on App Service.
¬†
You can buy an App Service domain and use it with your WordPress website. App Service Domains are custom domains that are managed directly in Azure. Also, if you have an existing custom domain registered with any other registrar, you can use that with your WordPress website as well. We will also learn how we can add subdomains if we have a custom doma‚Ä¶</a>

A cipher suite is a set of instructions that contains algorithms and protocols to help secure network connections between clients and servers. By default, the front-end‚Äôs OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end‚Äôs OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.
App Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

              How to increase concurrency on python function app hosted in app service plan?
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9799 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-increase-concurrency-on-python-function-app-hosted-in-app/ba-p/3882010>There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.
¬†

Based on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.
¬†
Lab1:
code:
sync

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT&#x3D;1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT&#x3D;1
Result:
It took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.

Lab2:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT&#x3D;1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT&#x3D;2
Result:
It took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

¬†
Lab3:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT&#x3D;2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT&#x3D;2
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

Lab4:
code:
async

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT&#x3D;1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT&#x3D;1
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

¬†
Conclusion:
1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing¬†FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and¬†PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency.¬†
2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.

              Scaling options in Azure Container Apps

As a container app revision scales out, new instances of the revision are created on-demand. These instances are known as replicas.
Adding or editing scaling rules creates a new revision of your container app. A revision is an immutable snapshot of your container app.¬†
¬†
Scaling is driven by different categories of triggers - this blog discusses HTTP and Custom triggers.¬†
¬†
HTTP SCALING
With an HTTP scaling rule, you have control over the threshold of concurrent HTTP requests that determines how your container app revision scales.

 The same mechanism applies when using the Function App Event Hubs Trigger, which stores the offset information in a storage account.
 In this document, we will discuss how to check the offset information for Event Hubs and how to set or reset the value.

              Load Custom Configuration (.ini) in PHP for Azure App Service
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9777 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/load-custom-configuration-ini-in-php-for-azure-app-service/ba-p/3878027>As a PHP developer, sometimes you might want to set the custom configuration file (.ini) to read when PHP starts up. For this article, I would like demonstrate how to load custom configuration file (.ini) in the Azure App Service.
¬†
By default, we set the PHP_INI_DIR &#x3D; /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, so when using SSH on Kudu, you could see there are lots of .ini files:

¬†
Based on this, you might think we could just manually add our custom .ini files in /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, but it will not work after restart. Since only &quot;/home&quot; data will be persistent after restarting App Service. So what we need to do is to add our .ini in &quot;/home&quot;, E.g. &quot;/home/site/ini&quot;
¬†
For example, if I would like to modify &quot;upload_max_filesize to 64M (defualt is 2M) and post_max_size to 64M (default is 8M)&quot; for the PHP website, I could follow the below steps to achieve it:
¬†
Step 1:
Use like vi/vim command to add setting.ini file in the &quot;/home/site/ini&quot; folder

¬†
Step 2:
PHP supports scanning multiple directories for .ini files. For this we need to set PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with &quot;:&quot; to separate values on the Application Setting for the target App Service.
E.g. PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR &#x3D; :/home/site/ini
This ensures that we load *.ini files from¬† /usr/local/etc/php and then load from /home/site/ini

¬†
¬†
After, we check the value by simple php page and it will show upload_max_size and post_max_size are set as 64M now.

¬† The SSV2 feature starts or stops Azure Virtual Machines instances across multiple subscriptions. It starts or stops virtual machines on user-defined¬† ¬†schedules, provides insights through Azure Application Insights, and sends optional notifications by using action groups.
¬† Azure offers an ARM template for deployment. So, you can easily deploy SSV2 using GitHub.
¬† For more detail, please see the SSV2 docs.
¬†
Purpose of SSV2
¬†The main purpose of using SSV2 is to save costs. By using Scheduled SSV2, we can turn on the VM only during business hours (ex. 9AM-6PM) and shut it down the rest of the time. Also, we can set the VM to automatically shut down when not in use by the Auto Stop function.In this post, I focus on how much we can save VM resource costs using SSV2.

To limit the traffic within the container app environment, an Nginx container was utilized as a reverse proxy server and public endpoint to direct all inbound traffics to the appropriate container app based on the URL. The traffic flow for this architecture is as follows:

To demonstrate how to achieve this, I created a simple proof-of-concept (POC) and would like to share the configuration details in case anyone is interested in creating a similar system.¬†

              Use preview environment for test in static web app
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9683 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/use-preview-environment-for-test-in-static-web-app/ba-p/3870476>Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.
¬†
Here are the steps to create a preview environment:
¬†
1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it &quot;dev&quot;.


¬†
2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include &quot;dev&quot; in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.

¬†
3. Set &quot;production_branch&quot; to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.

¬†
4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named &#x27;dev&#x27; for the dev branch.

¬†
5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the &quot;deployment_environment&quot; to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.

¬†

¬†
The main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named.¬†
¬†
Overall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment. The choice of environment type typically depends on the specific needs and development process of your project.</a>

KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.
For clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.</a>

              TLS/SSL Binding for custom domain contain special character
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9790 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/tls-ssl-binding-for-custom-domain-contain-special-character/ba-p/3864951>Overview:
We can secure a custom DNS name with the help of TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service.
¬†
When hosting a website on Azure App Service, it is important to ensure that the site is secure and can be accessed via a custom domain name. This can be achieved by using TLS/SSL binding, which encrypts data transmitted to and from the website, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is protected. With this setup, users can access the website via a custom domain name, which adds an extra layer of professionalism and branding to the site.
¬†
Issue:
The users are not able to purchase and bind the app service certificate for their app service having a custom domain with a special character from Azure Portal.
¬†
Solution and¬†recommendations:

Azure by default does not provide the facility to purchase the custom domain with the special character except periods and dashes.

¬†


The user can purchase the custom domain outside Azure with special characters apart from periods and dashes.
In this case, the user will not be able to purchase the App Service Certificate from Azure with the custom domain consists a special character.
To purchase and bind the Certificate with such domain from Azure Portal, the custom domain first needs to be converted to its Punny code using the below converter:

¬†
Punycode converter (IDN converter), Punycode to Unicode :wrench:(punycoder.com)

¬†

Purchase the certificate with the Punny code custom domain and bind the certificate with the app service custom domain.

Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
¬†

Browse the app service to verify the SSL Certificate.


¬†
If this helps you, do let me know via like and comments section, cheers!
Happy Learning!

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/07/03/recently.html>Writing in from Washington, DC, my once-hometown and
the birthplace of Mapbox.
This one will be quick because I‚Äôm between one thing
and another!
Listening
Dry Daniel by Buke and Gase

Buke and Gase released some music they recorded a while ago,
and there are some hits in it. I especially love this
track ‚ÄòBubbles,‚Äô which really could be a radio hit.
I‚Äôve also been listening to Spellcaster: The Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried,
which will probably be only one of 20 podcasts, TV shows,
movies, books about SBF. But it‚Äôs pretty good.
Bloomberg puts out good content!
Reading
I read Capital Without Borders,
which is a great add-on if you‚Äôve already read Piketty‚Äôs Capital
or anything by Zucman, Saez, etc. It really gives you a level-headed
perspective of what exactly the wealth management industry does,
and how it affects the word.
Right now, I‚Äôm reading Crabgrass Kingdom,
which I found via the New York Times piece on Vienna.
It‚Äôs pretty good, but unfortunately kind of dated - when it was
published in the 80s, US cities hadn‚Äôt started their arc back
toward growth and power. Still pretty good, though!
The Vienna piece is also highly recommended. Very few commentators
have said so clearly that we can‚Äôt fix America‚Äôs housing problems
without letting go of our obsession with owning houses as investments.
The Henry George Program
did, but of course they would.
Watching
I watched some trash this month - The Terminator,
They Live, and Next.
Unfortunately, I think I ran out of the good Nic Cage movies
four movies ago and it‚Äôs a slog to watch all the rest.
Only 22% done with watching the whole Cage filmography.</a>
