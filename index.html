              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220217090713.htm>Advanced imaging technology has helped scientists confirm that the destruction of brain synapses underlies the cognitive deficits experienced by patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. For many years, scientists have assumed that the loss of connections between brain cells caused Alzheimer&#x27;s-related symptoms, including memory loss, but actual evidence of the role of synaptic loss had been limited to a small number of brain biopsies and post-mortem brain exams conducted on patients with moderate or advanced disease. However, the emergence of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning technology has allowed researchers to observe the loss of synapses in living patients with even mild symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</a>

When we launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019, we set out to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with many customers to help them adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, Kroger, Liantis,¬†Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley‚Äôs, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.

Even though the pathophysiology of AD has been widely investigated, the likely relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the disease remains largely unknown. A research team has now confirmed that AD progression is linked to oxidative brain damage, which impairs cognitive function in AD transgenic mice in an age-dependent manner.</a>

So for this post we&#x27;re going to address that as we take a look at logging using the Azure Application Insights platform (often referred to as AppInsights).
If you&#x27;re deploying into Azure in the ways that we&#x27;ve looked at in this series, chances are you&#x27;re already using AppInsights, as it&#x27;s the cornerstone of Azure&#x27;s monitoring platform, so let&#x27;s look at how to get better insights out of our GraphQL server.
Side note: There&#x27;s a lot more you can do with AppInsights in monitoring your infrastructure, monitoring across resources‚Ä¶</a>

In this post we&#x27;ll look at how we can add authentication to our GraphQL server.
For the post, we&#x27;ll use the Apollo Server and Azure Static Web Apps for hosting the API, mainly because SWA provides security (and if you&#x27;re wondering, this is how I came across the need to write this recent post).
If you&#x27;re new to GraphQL on Azure, I&#x27;d encourage you to check out part 3 in which I go over how we can create a GraphQL server using Apollo and deploy that to an Azure Function, which is the process we&#x27;ll be using for this post.

This npm package works conceptually similar to the .NET one in that you annotate the Function handler to provide OpenAPI schema information. This is done using a wrapper, or higher order, function, which takes a JavaScript object in that represents the schema for OpenAPI.

I‚Äôm solving a lot of small problems that are each too small and niche
to merit their own blog post. But I hate letting things go unwritten,
so here they are, smorgasbord style.
Getting Tailwind and Radix to play nice together
I‚Äôve been using Tailwind for Placemark‚Äôs
CSS foundation, and Radix for many of its
UI components. This mostly works great, because Radix makes it easy
to style your own components.
However, there‚Äôs a catch: a lot of important UI states for Radix
are distinguished by aria accessibility properties or HTML data-
attributes. For example, when the trigger for a dropdown menu
is engaged, Radix adds data-state&#x3D;&quot;open&quot; to the element.
This is all fine and dandy if you‚Äôre writing new CSS classes, or using

At Ignite, we announced¬†Azure Container Apps, a serverless application-centric hosting service that enables users to quickly deploy containerized applications and microservices to Azure without the need to configure and manage underlying infrastructure resources or container orchestrators. Azure Container Apps runs on ¬†Azure Kubernetes Service, and includes several open-source projects:¬†Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA),¬†Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), and¬†Envoy. This open-source foundation enables teams to build and run portable applications powered by Kubernetes and open standards without the operational overhead and management complexity of working with the platform directly.

¬†
Azure PowerShell is a set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line. Azure PowerShell is designed to make it easy to learn and get started with, but provides powerful features for automation.

Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications. You focus on the pieces of code that matter most to you, and Functions handles the rest. Functions provides serverless compute for Azure. You can use Functions to build web APIs, resp‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
What is the discussion scope of this article?¬†

This article only discuss the Windows Azure App Service, Linux App Service is out of scope of this article.¬†

¬†
What happened?¬†

The Windows Azure App Service platform removed some minor NodeJS version. That could result in some un-expected result if the App Service&#x27;s configuration is not right.¬†

¬†
Is that removement is expected behavior?¬†

Yes.
Azure App Service is a PaaS service, and the platform will manage the Windows Node version.
The App Service Platform periodically refreshes the node version, and only keeps the latest two minor versions, and rem‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/02/01/recently.html>I read The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn
in January, and it radically reshaped my conception of local
politics and the general arc of city politics in the last 50 years.
Highly, highly recommended stuff.

Brian Lovin did a design crit of Placemark,
which has been powering a big burst of activity on that front.
The energy on Placemark is happening in two semi-parallel efforts:
knocking out the last few core concepts - layers and properties, mostly -
and running through this new, super-helpful list of ideas and
critiques from Brian. The last few days have been super, super
productive as a result, to the extent that I‚Äôll probably crash
and take a few days off in a little bit. But for now, I‚Äôve
got energy and direction, and I‚Äôve got to ride it.

Reading
This paper on Ethnographic Research on Dynamicland
resonated with me. You can read a lot about the technology
and business of these sorts of efforts, but rarely is there
someone looking for the human interactions, and Dynamicland
is one of the most unusual and ambitious projects out there.
Bachmann doesn‚Äôt editorialize much, but I think some
themes emerge, like the tension between ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù/collaboration versus
authority and vision.
It reminded me of The Idea Factory,
that great book about Bell Labs. Research labs are this odd thing -
part of what made Bell Labs great was the ability to work on a slightly
longer timeline, with fewer limitations on what you created. But
that ability was directly a result of the government‚Äôs explicit
permittance of AT&amp;T Bell as a monopoly, during that period of time.
Listening
Townes Van Zandt by Townes Van Zandt

Been on a Townes Van Zandt kick recently, sparked of course
by seeing If I Needed You
pop up in an episode of Patriot.


Almost every time I‚Äôm very productive, it coincides with a full listen-through
of the whole Joanna Newsom ouvre. There‚Äôs nothing like it.</a>

But Nginx does not have an equivalent to the .htaccess file, you need to update the main configuration and reload Nginx for any changes to take effect. NGINX is designed to be efficient. While using .htaccess can do harm to performance. For more details, please refer to¬†https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/likeapache-htaccess/.

              Dockershim deprecation and AKS
              <span class="post-metadata">(3 min | 815 words)</span> 
            </summary>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/dockershim-deprecation-and-aks/ba-p/3055902>The huge success of Docker in energizing the tech community around containers has been truly amazing to see.¬† As containers are the foundation of Kubernetes, it goes hand in hand that Docker was a core part of the platform. As Kubernetes matured, and the needs of the community and our customers grew, the tight coupling of Docker to Kubernetes through dockershim (the interface between the Kubernetes platform and the Docker runtime) needed to evolve. On 2 December 2020, with the release of Kubernetes 1.20, Kubernetes announced it is deprecating Docker as a container runtime, through the use of dockershim, in a future release of Kubernetes.
¬†
With the upcoming Kubernetes 1.24 release, dockershim will be removed.
¬†
If you are using a supported Kubernetes version in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

For Linux node pools, there is no action required on your part. All supported Kubernetes versions on AKS use containerd as the default runtime for Kubernetes 1.19 and greater.
For Windows Server 2019 node pools, in January 2021, we announced the general availability of containerd as the default container runtime for Kubernetes 1.23 and greater. If you are using a cluster with a Kubernetes version prior to 1.23, you can create a new node pool with containerd enabled before the switch over to it being the default in 1.23 then move your pods to the new pool.

¬†
We work very closely with the community through our participation in the Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIG) from Storage, to Windows and everything in between and I&#x27;d like to thank both the community and our engineering teams for the work to get to this milestone.</a>

¬†
In our¬†previous article¬†we explored how to deploy Grafana and Prometheus on AKS. However, despite Prometheus being an excellent way to monitor your AKS cluster, it lacks some functionality to save metrics for future use and enable us to query historical data.
¬†
Prometheus is a metrics collector, it can be used to collect metrics from any source, and it can be used to generate graphs. However, it is not a data storage solution and therefore isn&#x27;t not focused on storing data for historical purposes. Prometheus has its storage solution and supports both on-disk storage as well as remote locations. You can configure a lot of options but the data management options are limited. This is where Thanos can help.
