¬†
There are many reasons for this symptom, such as connection errors with the storage account, runtime being down, indexing failure, and the synctriggers failure that we&#x27;ll discuss.
¬†
To confirm whether your issue is indeed due to synctriggers, you could press F12 in your browser to activate developer mode and search for the keyword &quot;batch&quot; under the &quot;Network&quot; tab. This endpoint is used by the Azure portal to call various internal services of the Function App (e.g., retrieving app settings, site information, getting host status, etc.), including synctriggers.

You can easily create, configure, and execute load tests using JMeter scripts or custom code, and monitor the results in real-time on the Azure portal. You can also integrate your load tests with your CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub actions.
Until now, you could only view the load test results on the Azure portal, which required internet access and RBAC permissions. Now, you can download the report as an HTML file and share it with your stakeholders or teammates offline. The HTML report contains the same charts and metrics as the online report, but in a portable and convenient format.

Developers often feel that they need to become AI engineers to integrate the capabilities into their application.

How can I quickly validate an AI app idea, without investing too much time and resources?
If I have a working prototype, how fast can I scale it to production?

You don&#x27;t want to be outpaced by competitors or newer technologies, and you want to be able to quickly iterate on your ideas or pivot to new ones. This is where LangChain.js comes in.

              Better Debuggability with Enhanced Logging in Azure Load Testing

It allows you to validate the test configuration, understand the application behavior under load, and troubleshoot any issues that arise. Today, we are excited to introduce Debug mode in Azure Load Testing, which enables running low scale test runs with better debuggability and enhanced logging.
¬†
Why Debug Mode?
Debug mode is designed to help you validate your test configuration and application behavior by running a load test with a single engine for up to 10 minutes. It provides debug logs for the test script, and request and response data for every failed request during the test run. This mode is powerful for troubleshooting issues with your test plan configura‚Ä¶</a>

Adding Artificial intelligence (AI) to existing applications is becoming an important part in application development. The correct integration of AI is vital to meet business goals, functional and non-functional requirements and build applications that are efficient to maintain and enhance. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a key part in this integration and an API Manager is fundamental to keep control of the usage, performance, and versioning of APIs ‚Äì especially in enterprise landscapes.

Why we use it
An increasing number of security vulnerabilities are caused by sensitive information in the source code being leaked or accidentally uploaded to open repositories GitHub, leading to the exposure of a large amount of user privacy. This information includes, but is not limited to, database credentials, app keys, etc. Traditional MySQL databases use usernames and passwords for login operations, naturally leading to the inclusion of these credentials in project configuration files. Even with proper safeguards, there remain unpredictable risks, such as hacking.

This is a great way to secure your database and ensure that only the right people have access to it.
Note: For the purpose of this article, I&#x27;m going to use Entra ID to refer to a user identity, as well as a managed identity such as a service principal, as the approach is the same in this context here.
The above linked documentation covers how you would setup the Azure resource with Entra ID as the authentication mode, so I won&#x27;t go over that here (also, you can configure that when you initial create the database, or using a Bicep script), instead I want to look at how we use that in a .NET application, because when you&#x27;re connecting using Entra ID you don&#x27;t have a pas‚Ä¶</a>

nevertheless, these were numbers from multiple sources that could be charted

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that lets you test the performance and scalability of your web applications and APIs. You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.
Response time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining ‚Ä¶</a>

              Simplify Your Azure Kubernetes Service Connection Configuration with Service Connector
              <span class="post-metadata">(29 min | 8610 words)</span>

Users are required to manually configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID or Managed Identities so their AKS workloads can securely access these protected resources.
The Service Connector integration greatly simplifies the connection configuration experience for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. Service Connector takes care of authentication and network configurations securely and follows Azure best practices, so you can focus on your application code without worrying about your infrastructure connectivity.

Service Connector Action Breakdown
¬†
Before, in order to connect from AKS pods to a private Azure backing services using workload identity, users needed to perform the following actions manually:

Create a managed identity
Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL
Create Kubernetes service account
Establish federated identity credential trust
Grant permissions to access Azure Services
Deploy the application

Now, Service Connector performs steps 2 to 5 automatically. Additionally, for Azure services without public access, Service Connector creates private connection components such as private link, private endpoint, DNS record,
You can create a connection in the Service Connection blade within AKS.

¬†
Click create and select the target service, authentication method, and networking rule. The connection will then be automatically set up. Here are a few helpful links to for you to learn more about Service Connector.

Azure Load Testing is a fully managed service for performance testing that helps developers and testers easily generate high scale load and identify performance bottlenecks.
¬†
With multi-region load tests, you can now simulate load from multiple geographies simultaneously in a single test run, to closely mimic the real-life traffic patterns. With the in-built dashboard, you get an aggregate view of performance across regions, and you can drill down to a specific region and compare performance metrics across regions. Running multi-region load tests will also help you better validate your network architecture, load balancing components and failover capabi‚Ä¶</a>
