Blocking Fli-1&#x27;s action in a mouse model of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease reversed mental loss and reduced the brain inflammation and amyloid-beta clumping that are hallmarks of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Although clinical translation of this finding is likely years off, the study suggests Fli-1 is a promising therapeutic target for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</a>

They also devised a unique way of representing this data in two dimensions, making it easy to understand the past and future evolution of non-coding sequences in organisms beyond yeast -- and even design custom gene expression patterns for gene therapies and industrial applications. Despite the sheer number of genes that each human cell contains, these so-called &#x27;coding&#x27; DNA sequences comprise just 1% of our entire genome. The remaining 99% is made up of &#x27;non-coding&#x27; DNA -- which, unlike coding DNA, does not carry the instructions to build proteins.</a>

KUDU API provide the way to operate the App Service SCM/KUDU site easily. Such as you can do ZIP deployment, delete/undeploy files and get certain files etc.
Since KUDU API needs basic auth for authentication, we need to get the related credentials before configuring Azure DevOps pipeline. There are two kinds of credentials which you can use - Site level credential and user level credential. Below are the detailed steps to sh‚Ä¶</a>

Until now, the health benefits attributed to a Nordic diet by researchers primarily focused on weight loss. But in a new study, researchers found clear evidence that a Nordic diet can lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels even without weight loss. In particular, they point to the composition of dietary fats as a possible explanation for the diet&#x27;s positive effects.</a>

While cognitive function is often measured using paper and pencil tests with scores calculated by the number of correct answers, this number (score) omits a lot of information about the process a person uses to answer a question that might reveal important information about their brain function.</a>

Researchers say interventions focused on resistance exercises may be a way to improve sleep and, in turn, cardiovascular health.</a>

Files
The meaning and importance of the file has shifted a lot in the last
decade. The Verge wrote about how students today don‚Äôt have a grasp
on how files and folders work - or they have a very good understanding of the
norms of storing information in the cloud, but not on their local computers.
The web contains all sorts of things that we never think of or use as files:
is your email an Mbox file? Do you ever
directly use the HEIC files that
are the native format of Apple Photos? Or consider any rich text on the internet,
like a Notion page - does it have a defined file type and an option to download?
And think of the mobile web. You can download a file from mobile Safari, but

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220228161621.htm>Researchers from two independent research teams have discovered how the mislocalization of a protein, known as TDP-43, alters the genetic instructions for UNC13A, providing a possible therapeutic target that could also have implications in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other forms of dementia. ALS and FTD are two neurodegenerative disorders in which many cases are linked by mislocalization of TDP-43, where instead of being primarily located in the nucleus of the cell where genes are activated, it forms aggregates outside the nucleus in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Rare mutations in the TDP-43 gene are known to cause ALS, but almost all cases of ALS show mislocalization of TDP-43.</a>

One of them is that you are asked to generate the OpenAPI document from the function app right after the build and integrate it with Power Platform or Azure API Management. What if you want to do this process within your CI/CD pipeline?

Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how to generate the OpenAPI document within the GitHub Actions workflow right after the function app build.

NOTE: Let&#x27;s use the sample app provided by the Azure Functions OpenAPI Extension repository.

It was thoroughly refreshing. I‚Äôve been spending far too much time building a startup, reading about startups, being in the loop.

The thing about IndieWeb is that it‚Äôs still a place where people and ideas matter. You can have a whole conversation without mentioning money or a business plan. IndieWeb is about owning your own small parcel of internet-land and farming it with your own hands. Much like sharecropping, it isn‚Äôt ethically pure. But it‚Äôs a heck of a lot nicer than than the world built on value extraction and exclusion.

For many years, scientists have assumed that the loss of connections between brain cells caused Alzheimer&#x27;s-related symptoms, including memory loss, but actual evidence of the role of synaptic loss had been limited to a small number of brain biopsies and post-mortem brain exams conducted on patients with moderate or advanced disease. However, the emergence of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning technology has allowed researchers to observe the loss of synapses in living patients with even mild symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</a>

When we launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019, we set out to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with many customers to help them adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, Kroger, Liantis,¬†Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley‚Äôs, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220214095824.htm>Increased oxidative damage is linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD). Even though the pathophysiology of AD has been widely investigated, the likely relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the disease remains largely unknown. A research team has now confirmed that AD progression is linked to oxidative brain damage, which impairs cognitive function in AD transgenic mice in an age-dependent manner.</a>

So for this post we&#x27;re going to address that as we take a look at logging using the Azure Application Insights platform (often referred to as AppInsights).
If you&#x27;re deploying into Azure in the ways that we&#x27;ve looked at in this series, chances are you&#x27;re already using AppInsights, as it&#x27;s the cornerstone of Azure&#x27;s monitoring platform, so let&#x27;s look at how to get better insights out of our GraphQL server.
Side note: There&#x27;s a lot more you can do with AppInsights in monitoring your infrastructure, monitoring across resources‚Ä¶</a>

In this post we&#x27;ll look at how we can add authentication to our GraphQL server.
For the post, we&#x27;ll use the Apollo Server and Azure Static Web Apps for hosting the API, mainly because SWA provides security (and if you&#x27;re wondering, this is how I came across the need to write this recent post).
If you&#x27;re new to GraphQL on Azure, I&#x27;d encourage you to check out part 3 in which I go over how we can create a GraphQL server using Apollo and deploy that to an Azure Function, which is the process we&#x27;ll be using for this post.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/openapi-for-javascript-azure-functions/ba-p/3146739>OpenAPI, formerly known as Swagger (or still known, depending who you ask!), is used to describe a REST API&#x27;s.
Last year my colleague Justin Yoo released an extension for .NET Azure Functions to generate OpenAPI definitions and not long afterwards he reached out to me on whether it&#x27;d be possible to do something similar for JavaScript/TypeScript Functions.
Well, good news, I&#x27;ve created a npm package to do that, which you can find on GitHub and in this post we&#x27;ll take a look at how to use it.
How it works
This npm package works conceptually similar to the .NET one in that you annotate the Function handler to provide OpenAPI schema information. This is done using a wrapper, or higher order, function, which takes a JavaScript object in that represents the schema for OpenAPI.

A deeply generous friend may be a cutthroat colleague, for example. Using a game theory framework, researchers find that context-dependent behavior doesn&#x27;t stop cooperation from flourishing, especially when behavioral strategies can &#x27;spillover&#x27; between social settings.</a>
