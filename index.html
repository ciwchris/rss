An international team of scientists has now applied a new method to investigate the diet of fossil humans: the analysis of stable zinc isotopes from tooth enamel. This method proves particularly helpful to learn whether prehistoric humans and animals were primarily eating meat or plants.</a>

They found that aggression toward intimate partners was associated with aberrant activity in the brain&#x27;s medial prefrontal cortex, or MPFC, which has many functions, but among them is the ability to foster perceptions of closeness with and value of other people.</a>

These results are of great significance for the interpretation of brain scans depicting the distribution of glucose in the brain. Furthermore, such image-based data could potentially serve as a biomarker to non-invasively capture the response of microglia to therapeutic interventions in people with dementia.</a>

Milk&#x27;s sleep-enhancing properties are commonly ascribed to tryptophan, but scientists have also discovered a mixture of milk peptides, called casein tryptic hydrolysate (CTH), that relieves stress and enhances sleep. Now, researchers have identified specific peptides in CTH that might someday be used in new, natural sleep remedies.</a>

The drug, Axitinib, inhibits growth of new blood vessels in the brain -- a feature shared by both cancer tumors and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. This hallmark represents a new target for Alzheimer&#x27;s therapies. Mice that underwent the therapy not only exhibited a reduction in blood vessels and other Alzheimer&#x27;s markers in their brains, they also performed remarkably well in tests designed to measure learning and memory.</a>
