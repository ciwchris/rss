Apps like Microsoft Loop, Figma, Notion, Miro, Framer are redefining remote collaboration. 
Beyond hosting the newest and latest version of a file, these modern collaboration apps allow users to make edits to the same file at the same time as if they were physically next to each other.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their increasingly sophisticated capabilities, we’d like to explore how AI can further facilitate teamwork using the aforementioned collaboration applications.  
 
AI agent as another human collaborator
The mainstream way of interacting with a language model is through a familiar chat interface. One characteristic about this interaction that’s relevant to our discussion is that it’s…</a>

If your organization hasn’t yet made the switch, consider this blog a gentle nudge to prioritize your migration to App Service Environment v3 before the Aug. 31, 2024, deadline. As a reminder, starting on Jan. 15, 2024, users will no longer be able to create a new App Service Environment v1 or v2. Even though support for existing v1 or v2 environments will continue until the Aug. 31 deadline, App Service Environment created after Jan 15 will be on version 3. To avoid potential disruptions and ensure the seamless operation of your services, we strongly recommend initiating the migration process without del…</a>

Durable Functions (DF) enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. 
 
There are two major changes introduced in this release: upgrading to the latest version of the Azure Storage SDK (a breaking change for .NET in-process apps) and the introduction of a new partition manager. We describe these and the motivation for each in the sections below. 
 
Please note: 

At this time, DF extension v3.0.0-rc.1 is only supported in the App Service Plan. Auto-scaling support for the Consumption and Elastic Premium plans will be announced later. 
Durable Functions v3 does not support Azure Functions runtime V1.  …</a>

This announcement introduced new rendering modes and interactivity, allowing more flexibility to choose the right rendering mode for your Blazor web apps. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at standalone Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) projects, their considerations relative to other Blazor rendering modes, and how we can build full-stack .NET 8 serverless apps on Azure Static Web Apps with Blazor WASM and Functions APIs.

Azure Container Apps is a great platform for running polyglot apps and containers of all kinds in Azure, as it abstracts away the complexity of managing underlying Kubernetes while providing unified networking, observability, and scaling for higher developer velocity. While it serves as a versatile container platform, it may not offer precise insights into your Java applications or the state of your Java execution environment (such as the JVM). To better cater to our Java-centric customers running containerized apps, we&#x27;ve recently initiated a new journey to enhance the Java developer experience on Azure Container Apps.

We recommend that you switch to Azure Private Endpoints, which allow you to connect to your cluster privately within your VNet. We have released a preview feature that lets you migrate your VNet injected ADX cluster to Private Endpoints easily and quickly.</a>

              Bugtracker migration to GitLab completed
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 293 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/bugtracker-migration-to-gitlab-completed/>We are happy to announce that the migration of the bugtracker to GitLab is done! 🥳 
Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!
This means the issue tracker and merge requests on the GitLab package repos are now enabled.
The old bugtracker will subsequently be closed down. For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked Task #56716) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.
Packaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the &quot;Add a new Bug&quot; button on the package page on archlinux.org will automatically direct you to the correct place to open the issue. The workflow afterwards is mostly the same, first our Bug Wranglers will have a look at the issues and triage them, and then they will be handed over to the respective Package Maintainers to fix. A list of all issues can be found here.
If you do not have an account for GitLab already (which authenticates against our SSO service), please write us a mail with your desired username to accountsupport@archlinux.org as advised in the banner.</a>

Reading
I love shopping! I do. I love commerce — the dance of it, the etiquette. I love it as buyer and seller both. I love considering alternatives, and I love being considered. I love settling on favorites. I love stumbling across surprises.
Am I simply bourgeois? Yes, and I’ll wave that flag proudly. This is a big part of my politics: which is not a politics of “free markets” or “free trade”, but rather of systems that can support commerce and craft at every level, especially the smallest and most careful.

While upgrading to the latest versions of Spring Boot and JDK is a monumental step forward, bringing substantial performance improvements and new features to enjoy, it’s a fact that this leap can pose significant challenges and demand substantial effort from developers. Typically, open-source Spring project minor releases receive support for a minimum of 12 months from the date of initial release, and then making sure upgrading the Spring version timely before reaching the end-of-life date is a hard commitment to avoid putting your mission-critical workloads at risk.

Utilizing the Code+Test feature in the portal provides a straightforward method for testing, where you can simply click the &quot;Run&quot; button.
 
If your function is configured to be accessible from the public network, testing on your local PC is a viable option. However, in the scenario where the private endpoint is enabled within your function app, attempting to test may result in a 403 error accompanied by an error message.
Error message: You must have direct network access in order to run your function. Your app may be restricted with Private Endpoints, Access Restrictions or Service Endpoints.

 
Why did I get the 403 status code?

Socket.IO library is natively supported on Azure. Since we public previewed this feature, we received positive feedback from users. Now we are happy to share that Web PubSub for Socket.IO is generally available, which means that Azure customers can expect stable APIs, SLAs customer support and it’s suitable for use in production.
 
Solve the scalability issue without code rewrite.
When we interviewed Socket.IO users, the challenge of scaling out Socket.IO servers came up repeatedly. It’s a challenge that can be met uniquely by Azure. With the input from Socket.IO users, it’s a challenge we aimed to solve when we public previewed the support for Socket.IO on Azure two months ago. 
 
Developers can continue using the Socket.IO APIs they know and love and migrate to Azure seamless with…</a>

In this blog, I will take two senarios (function invocation is under long time running and function fails due to timeout) as examples for how to set the customized notifications. Below is one situation which might need customized notification:
Function invocations&#x27; time duration might span with a wide range (such as function which handles uploaded files whose size might be a few KB or more than tens GB), notification is needed if a function invocation persists for a long time or it fails with timeout.
 
Detailed steps for creating a customized notification as below:

Digital signatures provide a way for software consumers to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the containers deployed. Image signing has become one of the most popular solutions to the aforementioned concern. The signed container images enable users to ensure deployments are built from a trusted entity and verify that those images haven&#x27;t been tampered with since their creation.

The team has been hard at work making Azure the best platform to run Kubernetes and a truly Kubernetes-powered cloud.  And over the last year Microsoft continued to leverage AKS as a tried and test platform for its critical workloads, putting a healthy amount of pressure on the service and continuing to help us push the boundaries of what’s possible with cloud native platforms and intelligent apps.

 
 
As Kubernetes continues to become pervasive, a lot of teams find themselves at different steps of their adoption, skillset or learning …</a>

This gives customers the option to deploy into an environment that works with their overall workload. For the serverless Consumption plan, one of the most consistent feedback items for Azure Functions has been for networking features, such as private endpoints and VNet integration. We have also heard from many customers about projects with requirements that exceed what is currently possible on a single function app, both in terms of scaling speed and maximum instance count.
 
We are excited to introduce Flex Consumption, a new Azure Functions hosting option that offers flexibility without compromising on available features. It introduces private networking, instance size selection, concurrency c…</a>

This not only increases the development workload but also gives rise to maintenance and security challenges. However, the introduction of a gateway concept provides an innovative solution to these issues.
VMware Spring Cloud Gateway, acting as the first line of defense for all incoming requests, assumes the crucial responsibility of handling identity authentication, verifying user identities, and validating their permissions. This means that each microservice no longer needs to code authentication and authorization independently, thus reducing the development workload significantly.
