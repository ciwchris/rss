That has since been released, and in this post, we‚Äôll cover what you can expect throughout the rest of 2024.
¬†
.NET 8 option for the in-process model
Since our last post, we have released support for .NET 8 on the in-process model! Apps already using .NET 6 on the in-process model can move to .NET 8 by following the steps in the updating to target .NET 8 on the in-process model guidance.
¬†
Please keep in mind that support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026, and you‚Äôll want to begin planning your migration to the isolated worker model in advance of that date.
¬†
.NET 9 (Preview)
The isolated worker model now supports .NET 9 as a Preview on Linux, starting with .NET 9‚Ä¶</a>

This means your WordPress site can securely access other Azure resources, like Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server and Azure Communication Service Email, without the hassle of managing connection strings and secrets.

What is a managed Identity and why should you implement it for WordPress on App Service?
A frequent issue developers face is handling secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys needed for secure communication between services. Managed identities remove the necessity for developers to oversee these credentials.
Even though developers can securely store secrets in Azure Key Vault, services still require a method to access it. Managed identities offer an automatically managed id‚Ä¶</a>

In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to leverage Azure API Management to enhance the resiliency and capacity of your OpenAI Service.Azure API Management is a tool that assists in creating, publishing, managing, and securing APIs. It offers features like routing, caching, throttling, authentication, transformation, and more.By utilizing Azure API Management, you can:

Distribute requests across multiple instances of the Azure OpenAI Service using the priority-based load balancing technique, which includes groups with weight distribution inside the group. This helps spread the load across various resources and regions, thereby enhancing the availability and performance of your service.
Implement the circuit breaker pattern to protect your backend service from being overwhelmed ‚Ä¶</a>
