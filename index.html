VMware Spring Cloud Gateway, acting as the first line of defense for all incoming requests, assumes the crucial responsibility of handling identity authentication, verifying user identities, and validating their permissions. This means that each microservice no longer needs to code authentication and authorization independently, thus reducing the development workload significantly.

The company and product side of Placemark didn‚Äôt work out.
Some fantastic, friendly people used it, but I couldn‚Äôt find a way to make it work
as a sustainable bootstrapped startup. Building it was incredibly fun.
Failing to find success and sustainability was pretty hard but it‚Äôs okay.
Here‚Äôs the plan:
Today I‚Äôm turning off signups to Placemark.io.
Placemark is free for all existing customers until January 19, 2023,
at which point the servers will be shut down.
Later in January, I‚Äôll release the full source code to the site. This might
take a little while. It‚Äôs a big application.
Building Placemark was an incredible experience. I learned a ton and got to
know a lot of new people in the process. I‚Äôm really proud of what it turned
out to be, even if the business fell short of my goals.
I built, coded, designed, documented, marketed, and ran Placemark. It had paying
customers who used it for real-world purposes. It shipped, and it was a real business.
With luck, it‚Äôll become something as an open source project ‚Äì¬†either maintained,
or used as inspiration and fuel for future projects. I‚Äôm happy to create more
value than I capture.
There‚Äôs more to write about what I learned, but for now I just want to say
thanks to everyone who gave it a shot, and all of the people who were
supportive along the way - special thanks to
Gabriel Coch, Aaron Boodman,
Brian Lovin, Adam Krebs,
Prerna Nadathur, and many others.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/11/10/roll.html>I developed an old roll of film and the photos are pretty decent!
My Olympus XA-2 is
my default walking-around camera. I love it, but its age is showing
and I‚Äôm envious of the crisp photos that people get out of later-era
SLR film cameras. Thinking about getting a lightweight viewfinder
for my monstrous Nikon F, or buying something like a Nikon FM2.
There‚Äôs a paradox to this gear, though, and I don‚Äôt want to delude
myself into thinking that I‚Äôd use a slightly different camera more
when really the issue is that I‚Äôm not shooting many photos regardless.

These were shot with SantaColor,
which produces the strong green &amp; red channels. It‚Äôs interesting?
I chose not to ‚Äúcorrect it‚Äù all the way back to natural lighting.
Or I couldn‚Äôt find a way to do that without ruining the look.

Getting film developed is harder than ever, but most major cities
have an option.
In New York, I use Gelatin and
Pink Folder Film House
In DC, I used Dodge Chrome
In San Francisco, I used Photoworks

I‚Äôm still using Capture One to manage my photos, which is expensive and vastly overkill but
really nice, focused, ‚Äúpro‚Äù software.</a>

To better understand the importance of this feature, it would be helpful to understand the current set-up on App Service and how incoming traffic and intra-clusters traffic are handled. Incoming requests to App Service could always be secured with TLS encryption on both multi-tenant and App Service Environments (ASE). However, these incoming HTTPS requests would have TLS terminated on our front-ends and continue as HTTP to the workers running the application workloads. For a few years now, applications running on ASE have had the option to configure and to enable E2E TLS encryption intra-clusters, though this‚Ä¶</a>

If you are working with many App Service plans, managing the subnets can be an unnecessary administrative task. Therefore, I am happy to announce that we are introducing Multi-plan subnet join (MPSJ) in limited public preview at Ignite 2023.

MPSJ reduces subnet sprawl when dealing with many apps across many plans and simplifies management of networking control such as Network Security Groups and Route tables across App Service plans. With MPSJ you can join a virtual network/subnet in a different subscription, but all App Service plan joining a specific subnet must be in the same subscription.

              Incoming changes in JDK / JRE 21 packages may require manual intervention
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 306 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/incoming-changes-in-jdk-jre-21-packages-may-require-manual-intervention/>We are introducing a change in JDK/JRE packages of our distro. This is
triggered from the way a JRE is build in modern versions of Java (&gt;9). We are
introducing this change in Java 21.
To sum it up instead of having JDK and JRE packages coexist in the same system
we will be making them conflict. The JDK variant package includes the runtime
environment to execute Java applications so if one needs compilation and
runtime of Java they need only the JDK package in the future. If, on the other
hand, they need just runtime of Java then JRE (or jre-headless) will work.
This will (potentially) require a manual user action during upgrade:
If you have both JDK and JRE installed you can manually install the JDK
with pacman -Syu jdk-openjdk and this removes the JRE related packages.
If you have both JRE and JRE-headless you will need to choose one of
them and install it manually since they would conflict each other now.
If you only have one of the JDK/JRE/JRE-headless pacman should resolve
dependencies normally and no action is needed.
At the moment this is only valid for the upcoming JDK 21 release.</a>

The network plugin determines how the pods and nodes communicate with each other and with external resources. 
Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on your requirements and preferences.

In this blog post, I will explain the differences between Kubenet and Azure CNI, and help you choose the best option for your AKS cluster.

Here is a short overview of the network plugin types available to Azure Kubernetes Service:

Really took advantage of the breadth of New York culture: I saw an opera at the Metropolitan Opera House, and then went to see prog-metal band Polyphia play guitar solos as fast as possible. At the latter, there were multiple mosh pits and the most packed audience I‚Äôve ever encountered. It was my first ‚Äòmetal‚Äô oriented concert, and the friendliness and openness of everyone who attended was remarkable.


Via Arts Gowanus, I saw lots of local art and was especially struck by Perrin Ireland‚Äôs art about animals, gender, and climate change.

This tutorial outlines a graceful process for developing and deploying a Linux Docker container on your Windows PC, making it easy to deploy to Azure resources.
¬†
This tutorial emphasizes using the user interface to complete most of the steps, making the process more reliable and understandable. While there are a few steps that require the use of command lines, the majority of tasks can be completed using the UI. This focus on the UI is what makes the process graceful and user-friendly.
¬†
In this tutorial, we will use a Python Flask application as an example, but the steps should be similar for other languages such as Node.js.

for my Tidbyt in Rust.
It has been a slow, silly process in which I celebrate when a single
pixel lights up on the device. I‚Äôm not even writing firmware or code
that runs ‚Äúon the device‚Äù - that‚Äôs a stretch goal for someday.
I‚Äôm just writing a Rust program that renders some WebP graphics and
pushes them to Tidbyt‚Äôs API.

I‚Äôve had a lot of type 2 fun. I‚Äôve also learned a lot more about Rust.
It‚Äôs probably not useful for many people, but
the repository is now open source.
There‚Äôs a little implementation of checking a Fastmail email
account to get a count of unread emails and Strava for new runs.
Plus, there‚Äôs an implementation of checking
weather with weather.gov, UV exposure
from an EPA API, and AQI from AirNow.
