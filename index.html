We realised that the variety of available methods might confuse developers. For instance, when should one use import_plugin_from_object() versus import_native_plugin_from_directory()?

This functionality, powered by Azure Load Testing, enables you to get started with your performance testing journey in a few clicks.
¬†
Using the Load Testing functionality in App Service web apps you can do the following:

Get started without any knowledge of performance testing tools by configuring your HTTP request details in the Azure portal.
Run tests with up to 100,000 concurrent virtual users and up to 24-hour duration to simulate load testing scenarios like stress testing, spike testing, endurance testing etc.
Automatically gain access to client-side and server-side metrics, which will help in identifying performance bottlenecks.
View the test run history to continuously monitor their web app performance.

¬†
Navigate to your App Service web app in Azure portal to find the Load Testing feature in the Performance section as shown below.Screenshot of Load Testing feature in Azure App service portal

And when things move fast, you need to be able to experiment and iterate quickly. First to validate your ideas with a prototype, then to scale up to production if it works.

In this article, we&#x27;ll show you how LangChain.js, Ollama with Mistral 7B model and Azure can be used together to build a serverless chatbot that can answer questions using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. We&#x27;ll see first how you can work fully locally to develop and test your chatbot, and then deploy it to the cloud with state-of-the-art OpenAI models.

good humor - introducing himself as the other founder of Aboard.

The feedback loop for plugins is okay - you can see how many likes
your plugin has received, and how many ‚Äúusers‚Äù there are, but no
change-over-time statistics, so I built my own dashboard for the plugins using Observable.


But even with that, I don‚Äôt really know whether many people are
actually using them. Maybe ‚Äúusers‚Äù means unique installations - it

Integrating a React Single Page Application (SPA) with a Python backend on Azure App Service offers a powerful combination for building dynamic web applications. By leveraging React for the frontend and Python for the backend, developers can create modern, responsive web applications with a seamless user experience.

Azure App Service provides a convenient platform for hosting both frontend and backend components of your application in a single environment, simplifying deployment and management tasks. With this setup, the React frontend can communicate with the Python backend through HTTP requests, enabling data exchange and interaction between the two layers.

In that post, we outlined a plan to stagger the .NET 8 releases, with support first coming to the isolated worker model, and the in-process model option coming a bit later. This is still the plan, and in this post, we wanted to discuss a bit more about how things will work once the option is available.

How the in-process model option for .NET 8 will work
One key difference between this and previous .NET version changes for the in-process model is that it will be an update solely focused on enabling .NET 8 support. There will be no additional Functions-specific breaking changes from the latest host version for .NET 6 that your project would‚Ä¶</a>

With Azure Static Web Apps‚Äô recently announced improved support for Next.js, we can easily deploy and host our Next.js applications on Azure, while leveraging Next.js‚Äô recent features such as React Server Components and Server Actions. In this article, we‚Äôll build and deploy a Next.js application to Azure Static Web Apps (and you can follow along with the free plan!). (Follow along with the complete application available on GitHub, or try it out here).
