This approach allows you to have full flexibility over your database calls but building out such a backend can be tedious and complex, especially when considering the edge cases of a data-access backend such as authorization and relationships. With Static Web Apps‚Äô database connections feature, and its underlying open-source project Data API Builder, you now have more options to build out database-backed web applications. In this blog article, we cover the considerations of choosing between these various options.

MongoDB Atlas¬†and Azure are great friends! In fact, they became even better friends recently with the addition of the MongoDB Atlas Pas-as-You-Go Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription to the Azure Marketplace, allowing you to use your existing Azure credits to enjoy all the benefits of the MongoDB Atlas Developer Data Platform. So there is no better time to learn how you can take advantage of both of these.
¬†
In this article, we are going to see how you can deploy a MERN stack application to Azure Web Apps, part of Azure App Service, in a few simple steps. By the end of this, you will have your own version of the website that can be found here.

One of the best ways to do this is by collecting a network trace. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll walk you through the process of collecting a network trace on Azure Container App using the &#x60;tcpdump&#x60;¬†tool.
¬†
Step 1: Accessing the Azure Container App Console
To access the Azure Container App Console, navigate to your container app in the Azure Portal. Once you&#x27;ve selected your container app, click on the &quot;Console&quot; option under the &quot;Monitoring&quot; blade. This will open up a terminal window in your browser that you can use to connect to your container.

Step 2: Installing &#x60;tcpdump&#x60;
In case &#x60;tcpdump&#x60; is not installed on your container,¬†you can easily install it using the package ‚Ä¶</a>

The solution may be simpler than you think.
¬†
In this post, I&#x27;ll walk you through the steps involved, which include:

creating an &quot;azure.yaml&quot; file via &#x60;azd init&#x60;
adding a &quot;main.parameters.json&quot; file
properly tagging your resource group and resources with &#x60;azd-env-name&#x60;
for deployment targets, add the corresponding &#x60;azd-service-name&#x60; tag as defined in &quot;azure.yaml&quot;

To demonstrate the process, I collaborated with my colleague Farhat Saleem in the Customer Success Team to azd-ify¬†a sample integration app template that guides users through the process of setting up API Management policy for sending data to Azure ‚Ä¶</a>

This plan is now in public preview so you can start creating and deploying apps today. This new plan is super-efficient because you can start from zero and scale to zero vCPU. ¬†You get more straightforward pricing across your containerized applications since it costs the same as Azure Container Apps, but with added value for Spring apps.
¬†
How does this work? With the new plan, you can deploy apps that don‚Äôt need to run all the time or apps that have bursts of traffic and only pay for the resources used. This is a ‚Äúserverless plan‚Äù, which means your apps can scale out and in automatically depending on the number of HTTP requests or events they receive or simply run as always-on background jobs.

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code on-demand without having to manage infrastructure. It supports various types of triggers, including HTTP triggers, which allow you to expose your function as a RESTful API.
However, while working with Azure Function HTTP triggers, you may encounter a 404 error, which indicates that the requested resource was not found.
In this blog, we will learn the possible causes of the Azure Function HTTP trigger 404 error, along with examples to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

Causes of Azure Function HTTP Trigger 404 Error

This is the last in the three part sub-series looking at the newly launched Data API builder for Azure Databases (DAB) and while last time we looked at creating a React application, this time I wanted to look at how to do the same thing but in .NET using Blazor. So let&#x27;s jump in and learn about how to use SWA Data Connections with Blazor.
Oh, and for something different, let&#x27;s try also use a SQL backend rather than Cosmos DB.
Setting up DAB
When we&#x27;ve looked at DAB so far, we&#x27;ve had to create two files, a config for DAB and a GraphQL schema containing the types. Well since we&#x27;re using SQL this time we can drop the GraphQL schema file, as DAB will use the SQL schema to generate the types, something it couldn&#x27;t do fro‚Ä¶</a>

In the last post I introduced you to a new project we&#x27;ve been working on, Data API builder for Azure Databases (DAB) and in this post I want to look at how we can use it in Azure, and that will be through one of my favourite Azure services, Azure Static Web Apps, for you see, as part of the announcement today of DAB, we&#x27;ve announced that it is available as a feature of SWA (called Database Connections), so let&#x27;s build a React app!
Local Development
One of the neat things about working with SWA is that we have a CLI tool which emulates the functionality of SWA, and with today&#x27;s announcement, we can use it to emulate the Database Connections feature, so let&#x27;s get started. First off, we need to ensure we have the lates‚Ä¶</a>

I&#x27;m really excited because today we launched the first public preview of Data API builder for Azure Databases or DAB for short (the official name is a bit of a mouthful ¬≠;p).
The important links you&#x27;ll need are:

SQL announcement
Cosmos announcement
Docs
SWA integration announcement

What is DAB
DAB is a joint effort from the Azure SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Cosmos DB teams to provide a simple and easy way to create REST and GraphQL endpoints from your existing database. Now obviously this is something that you&#x27;ve always been able to do, but the difference is that DAB does it for you (after all, that&#x27;s the point of this series) so rather than having to write an ASP.NET application, data layer, authentica‚Ä¶</a>

In case you do not have an existing App Service and Azure Database for MySQL setup, you can follow this blog: Tutorial: PHP app with MySQL - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn.


This setup will create a VNET and MySQL database where the MySQL access will be locked down and not exposed to the public internet, which is compliant with recommended best practices for security.


To migrate your PHP code to Azure App Service, we can use one of the deployment methods such as Zip Deploy: Run your app from a ZIP package - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn

              Azure function app doesn&#x27;t work after unlinking to Azure static web app
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9591 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-function-app-doesn-t-work-after-unlinking-to-azure-static/ba-p/3759599>As we know, we can link existing Azure function app to Azure static web app. After that, the Azure Functions app will be mapped to the /api route of your static web app.
¬†
In the following example, function app tonytesthttp has been linked to static web app.
¬†

¬†
When we try to access the function app outside static webapp, we will encounter Bad Request error. We understand that the static web app must do something to block the request. We can try to unlink the function app from static web app. However, you will find the function app still encounters the same error. How can we make our function app back to normal?
¬†

¬†
If you read the official document (Bring your own functions to Azure Static Web Apps | Microsoft Learn) carefully, you will find following statement.
¬†
If authentication and authorization policies aren&#x27;t already set up on your existing Functions app, then the static web app has exclusive access to the API. To make your Functions app accessible to other applications, add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.
¬†
It seems that the link operation will add authentication limitation to only allow static webapp to access the function app. If you navigate to the authentication setting of the function app, you will find the static webapp was added as an identity provider. Even we unlink the function app to static webapp, the identity provider will not be removed automatically. We need to remove the identity provider manually. After that, the function app will work again.</a>

I enjoyed reading Ross Barkan‚Äôs What to Do About Police,
though it‚Äôs bound to generate some controversy. Barkan is,
I think, a geniunely ‚Äòcenter‚Äô or balanced commentator, if you
consider the political spectrum of major American cities as the
guide. He also has a sense for reading polls and knowing people
enough to identify surprising but true disconnects between what
we think people believe and what they do.
There‚Äôs a strangely libertarian tinge to the leftist arguments around defunding and abolishing the police. The NYPD budget is described as ‚Äúbl‚Ä¶</a>

Azure App Service provides sets of authentication technologies to protect and secure your web application. However, it is a steep learning curve to know all of them, and we often get lost in the details of the documentations. The purpose of the article is to give you an intuitive way to understand the authentication features in App Service and a high-level summary of different authentication models, their usage scenarios and useful links.

There is a symptom with low throughput in Service Bus triggered function due to Service Bus&#x27;s message session enabled. This blog we&#x27;re going to do a lab to demonstrate the cause and effect of this situation.

Common causes:
According to session features description (Azure Service Bus message sessions - Azure Service Bus | Microsoft Learn), since a session receiver is created by a client accepting a session. When the session is accepted and held by a client, the client holds an exclusive lock on all messages with that session&#x27;s session ID in the queue or subscription. It will also hold exclusive locks on all messages with the session ID that will arrive later.

Hence, if all the messages are with same session id, there is only one receiver can consume these messages one by one‚Ä¶</a>

Pod Sandboxing compliments other security measures and data protection controls and provides the isolation needed within a single VM node, as well as to protect containers that process sensitive information on AKS. This added functionality also avoids the ‚Äúoperations tax‚Äù associated with running standard VM nodes per workload. Pod sandboxing on AKS seamlessly integrates with the existing AKS feature set, making it easy to transition the deployment with simple pod annotation changes to existing workloads while continuing to use existing deployment and monitoring practices.
