The App Service VNet integration feature enables your apps to access resources in or through a virtual network but doesn&#x27;t grant inbound private access to your apps. For inbound access, you need private endpoints, which allow clients located in your private network to securely access your apps over Private Link, which eliminates exposure from the public internet.

With this update, you can use our lower-cost tiers and achieve the same level of security that you could previously only achieve with our high-end SKUs.

Solution Architecture

Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re building a microservices architecture. It typically consists of an API gateway and many API apps, which are Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Functions API in this example. The microservices architecture might be more complex depending on the requirements, but it&#x27;s way too far from our topic. Therefore, let&#x27;s build a minimal structure that is working. Here&#x27;s the diagram.

This technique has allowed researchers to rewind the cellular biological clock by around 30 years according to molecular measures, significantly longer than previous reprogramming methods. The partially rejuvenated cells showed signs of behaving more like youthful cells in experiments simulating a skin wound. This research, although in early stages, could eventually have implications for regenerative medicine, especially if it can be replicated in other cell types.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220406132428.htm>Researchers evaluated whether dietary fiber intake was associated with a decrease in inflammation in older adults and if fiber was inversely related to cardiovascular disease. The results showed that total fiber, and more specifically cereal fiber but not fruit or vegetable fiber, was consistently associated with lower inflammation and lower CVD incidence. Until now there had been limited data on the link between fiber and inflammation among older adults, who have higher levels of inflammation compared with younger adults.</a>

The charts are the result of a research project spanning six continents and bringing together possibly the largest ever MRI datasets ever aggregated -- almost 125,000 brain scans from over a 100 different studies. Although not currently intended for clinical use, the team hopes the charts will become a routine clinical tool similar to how standardised paediatric growth charts are used.</a>

So, what‚Äôs changed?
Azure Function Proxies ‚Üí Azure API Management
The use of Azure Function Proxies has been decommissioned in V4, and it will be replaced by APIM(Azure API Management) instead. APIM will come as a separate service with more functionalities and built-in security sets, version controls, and more. For details‚Ä¶</a>

These urges --known as cravings-- are very common, especially during pregnancy. During this time, the mother&#x27;s body undergoes a series of physiological and behavioral changes to create a favorable environment for the embryo&#x27;s development. However, the frequent consumption of tasty and high calorie foods -- derived from the cravings -- contributes to weight gain and obesity in pregnancy, which can have negative effects on the baby&#x27;s health.</a>

However, about 20% of patients develop incurable metastatic prostate cancer, resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths each year in Austria alone. Medical research has not yet adequately explained why metastases occur in some people and not in others. A research team has now discovered specific changes in a protein that drive the growth and spread of prostate cancer.</a>

The researchers also collected urine samples, most of which contained secondary metabolites of ethanol. The results provide further evidence that our primate ancestors preferentially sought out fermented, alcohol-containing fruit likely for its greater nutritional value, and that humans may have inherited this proclivity for ethanol.</a>

A new study with more than 200 participants now provides insights into the interaction of these pathological phenomena. The data suggest that tau load in the brain impairs memory functions only when amyloid burden is also high. These findings therefore support therapeutic approaches aimed at removing amyloid from the brain in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</a>

Increased social media use again predicts lower life satisfaction at age 19 years. At other times the link was not statistically significant.</a>

Genetic evidence in this same population suggested that all levels of alcohol intake are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Notably, the risk of cardiovascular disease linked to light alcohol consumption was modest but rose exponentially with higher intake, even at intake levels currently endorsed as &#x27;low risk.&#x27;</a>

Since upstream officially moved to Quarkus distribution, Arch Linux follows this approach. This means some manual intervention is required for the upgrade.
The configuration needs to be adjusted from the old .xml format to the new /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf.
Prior to the upgrade, stop the keycloak service, upgrade the package and migrate the configuration before starting:
systemctl stop keycloak.service
pacman -Syu keycloak
# migrate configuration /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf
systemctl start keycloak.service

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220325093722.htm>Pregnant women with anorexia are at greater risk of having a stillbirth, underweight baby or pre-term birth, yet there are no clear guidelines for how doctors should manage the condition, according to a new study. Researchers have developed recommendations and principles for multidisciplinary management of anorexia nervosa in pregnancy. These recommendations include a focus on the specialist mental health, obstetric, medical, and nutritional care required to ensure optimal outcomes for women and their infants.</a>

These trends held true for both people with and without cardiovascular disease. Researchers said the analyses -- the largest to look at coffee&#x27;s potential role in heart disease and death -- provide reassurance that coffee isn&#x27;t tied to new or worsening heart disease and may actually be heart protective.</a>

Shift work has also been known to have a negative effect on workers&#x27; health. A new study suggests it also may delay the onset of natural menopause, possibly because of disruptions in circadian rhythms.</a>

Now researchers have found that this is largely controlled by our genes. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms that control appetite and energy metabolism early in life and can help us find better treatment for obesity in adolescence and adulthood.</a>

Individuals aged 68 and above who were physically active throughout their life have healthier aging muscle that has superior function and is more resistant to fatigue compared to inactive individuals, both young and old. This is the first study to investigate muscle, stem cell and nerve activity in humans. The researchers from University of Copenhagen, Denmark, found that elderly individuals who keep physically active throughout their adult life, whether by taking part in resistance exercise, ball games, racket sports, swimming, cycling, running and/or rowing had a greater number of muscle stem cells, otherwise known as satellite cells in their muscle. These cells are important for muscle regeneration and long-term growth and protect against nerve decay.</a>

The SCM site is the engine behind App Service for deployment, meaning that the release pipeline of Azure DevOps deploys code to the SCM site of an app. In most scenario, SCM site can be reached through public internet. Therefore, ensuring secure access to the site becomes more important. We can enable access restriction on SCM site or set up other firewall solutions to control incoming traffic to the site.

Here we will introduce you on how to identify and whitelist deployment traffic from Azure pipeline to SCM site with access restriction. This article also applies when setting up the same rules in other firewall solutions.
