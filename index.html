The study&#x27;s findings suggest that abnormal development in the brain&#x27;s centers for reward and inhibition may play a role. In the children with binge eating disorder, researchers saw elevations in gray matter density in areas that are typically &#x27;pruned&#x27; during healthy brain development. Disturbed synaptic pruning is linked to a number of psychiatric disorders.</a>

Today, we are announcing the Public Preview of support for clustered deployments of JBoss EAP on App Service. This means customers can run Java EE, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications which use stateful session beans, distributed transactions, and similar features that require instance-to-instance communication or high availability. Previously, individual JBoss EAP instances on App Service could not communicate with one another; with this update all nodes can communicate over a virtual network. Read on to learn more!

¬†

&quot;What if we can provision Azure Static Web App and deploy the app at the same time? If we can, we just simply hand over our PoC repository to developers so that they just run it directly from there.&quot;

¬†
Although two challenges exist to achieve this idea, if we can combine both challenges, devs can autopilot everything from the resource creating to the app deployment, which will result in improving the development experiences. Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how to offer the autopilot feature for your application repository.

You can download the sample code from this repository.

I really like alternative display technology.
eInk displays,
unlit LEDs, like on my AlphaSmart,
or flip-disc displays,
vane displays,
split-flap displays - I wish
it was all more widespread. Sure, those flip board displays have
mechanical failures more often than traditional screens, but
they look and sound so nice.
Most alternative display technology is expensive and inconvenient,
especially when compared to the absolute marvel of supply-chain
efficiency that is modern traditional LED displays. You can buy
a decent 39‚Äù TV for a little over $200 today. A 31‚Äù eInk panel will run you
$1,500, and a fl‚Ä¶</a>

They also devised a unique way of representing this data in two dimensions, making it easy to understand the past and future evolution of non-coding sequences in organisms beyond yeast -- and even design custom gene expression patterns for gene therapies and industrial applications. Despite the sheer number of genes that each human cell contains, these so-called &#x27;coding&#x27; DNA sequences comprise just 1% of our entire genome. The remaining 99% is made up of &#x27;non-coding&#x27; DNA -- which, unlike coding DNA, does not carry the instructions to build proteins.</a>

KUDU API provide the way to operate the App Service SCM/KUDU site easily. Such as you can do ZIP deployment, delete/undeploy files and get certain files etc.

Our various organs and systems may have different ages, at least from a biological perspective. Investigators used biomarkers, statistical modeling, and other techniques to develop tools for measuring the biological ages of various organ systems. Based on their findings, the researchers report that there are multiple &#x27;clocks&#x27; within the body that vary widely based on factors including genetics and lifestyle in each individual.</a>

Our various organs and systems may have different ages, at least from a biological perspective. Investigators used biomarkers, statistical modeling, and other techniques to develop tools for measuring the biological ages of various organ systems. Based on their findings, the researchers report that there are multiple &#x27;clocks&#x27; within the body that vary widely based on factors including genetics and lifestyle in each individual.</a>

While cognitive function is often measured using paper and pencil tests with scores calculated by the number of correct answers, this number (score) omits a lot of information about the process a person uses to answer a question that might reveal important information about their brain function.</a>

Activation of MondoA protected against aging and age-associated kidney injury, indicating its potential as a target for the treatment of aging and age-related diseases.</a>

norms of storing information in the cloud, but not on their local computers.
The web contains all sorts of things that we never think of or use as files:
is your email an Mbox file? Do you ever
directly use the HEIC files that

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220228161621.htm>Researchers from two independent research teams have discovered how the mislocalization of a protein, known as TDP-43, alters the genetic instructions for UNC13A, providing a possible therapeutic target that could also have implications in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other forms of dementia. ALS and FTD are two neurodegenerative disorders in which many cases are linked by mislocalization of TDP-43, where instead of being primarily located in the nucleus of the cell where genes are activated, it forms aggregates outside the nucleus in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Rare mutations in the TDP-43 gene are known to cause ALS, but almost all cases of ALS show mislocalization of TDP-43.</a>

One of them is that you are asked to generate the OpenAPI document from the function app right after the build and integrate it with Power Platform or Azure API Management. What if you want to do this process within your CI/CD pipeline?
¬†
Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how to generate the OpenAPI document within the GitHub Actions workflow right after the function app build.

NOTE: Let&#x27;s use the sample app provided by the Azure Functions OpenAPI Extension repository.

First of all, you need to install the Azure Functions Core Tools within your GitHub Actions workflow. Installing the tool varies depending on the runner OS. The command‚Ä¶</a>

Unlike Windows App Service, it used to be difficult for App Service on Linux users to make an SSH connection to the intended instance. You might need to handle Session affinity cookie (ARR cookie) or clean up cookies to allow KUDU to randomly choose an instance to attach.

On new UI, you can choose the instance as easy as the App Service on Windows!

It was thoroughly refreshing. I‚Äôve been spending far too much time building a startup, reading about startups, being in the loop.

The thing about IndieWeb is that it‚Äôs still a place where people and ideas matter. You can have a whole conversation without mentioning money or a business plan. IndieWeb is about owning your own small parcel of internet-land and farming it with your own hands. Much like sharecropping, it isn‚Äôt ethically pure. But it‚Äôs a heck of a lot nicer than than the world built on value extraction and exclusion.

For many years, scientists have assumed that the loss of connections between brain cells caused Alzheimer&#x27;s-related symptoms, including memory loss, but actual evidence of the role of synaptic loss had been limited to a small number of brain biopsies and post-mortem brain exams conducted on patients with moderate or advanced disease. However, the emergence of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning technology has allowed researchers to observe the loss of synapses in living patients with even mild symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</a>

When we launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019, we set out to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with many customers to help them adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, Kroger, Liantis,¬†Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley‚Äôs, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.
