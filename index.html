Databases are responsible for storing and managing vast amounts of data, providing real-time access to information, and powering critical business operations. As the amount of data and the number of users accessing databases continues to grow, it is essential to ensure that they can handle the expected workload and perform efficiently under heavy traffic. Whether you are launching a new application or getting ready for peak traffic, load testing helps you ensure that your database can handle the load and deliver reliable performance.

Recently I am having an increasing number of conversations with customers on how best to manage container images in disconnected or highly restricted environments. Cluster security is becoming increasingly more important, a 2023 report by Red Hat showed that 90% of enterprises surveyed had experienced a security incident in their Kubernetes environments in the last 12 months.

When doing this a problem arises regarding how to manage public container images that may b‚Ä¶</a>

¬†

¬†
A common problem encountered when having Azure App Service behind Azure Application Gateway is
whether we can use the cookie-based affinity feature on Azure Application Gateway end instead to maintain session stickiness.
¬†

¬†
Answer is NO. Because as explained at Azure - Inside the Azure App Service Architecture | Microsoft Learn Azure App Service is distributed system 
and has its own frontend workers and backend workers, 
enabling cookie-based affinity on Application Gateway side only allows requests from the same end user to 
get routed to the same App Service frontend workers within a session 
and we still need the ARR Affinity ‚Ä¶</a>

These tools include &quot;Auto-Heal&quot;, &quot;Proactive CPU Monitoring&quot;, and &quot;Crash Monitoring&quot;. In this document, we will guide you through the process of enabling them using PowerShell scripts, so you can easily automate them in your deployment pipeline.
Since each tool has its own configuration settings, we will discuss them individually to provide you with a clear understanding of how to enable and configure them for your app.

1. Auto-Heal
Auto-Heal is a feature in Azure App Service that automatically detects and resolves certain application failures. When Auto-Heal is triggered, it can take actions such as restarting the app, recycling the app pool, or sending an email notifica‚Ä¶</a>

Java Memory Management

Heap memory

Young Generation: where all new objects are allocated and aged
Eden Space: where new objects are allocated
Survivor Space: where objects moved from Eden after surviving one garbage collection cycle are. Survivor Space is divided to two parts, s1 and s2.
Old Generation: also called Tenured Space, where objects having remained in the survivor spaces for a long time are.


Non-heap memory: By default the maximun it size is the 1/4 of the memory requested

Metaspace : which stores the class definitions loaded by class loaders
Compressed Class Space: which is for compressed class pointers
Code Cache: which stores native code compiled by JIT
Thread stack: Thread Stack memory is used for execution of a thread. ‚Ä¶</a>

Recently in May, I can still talk about Achieving Our Country,

really clicked with me: someone who wants there to be a thriving
left and is fully on board with the theories in Piketty‚Äôs Capital

Bug fixes: Although all software undergoes multiple rounds of tests before release, some small bugs might go unnoticed. Developers fix these bugs when they are discovered and ship them via updates.
Performance enhancements: New updates also come with optimizations which increase performance. Ensuring the system is up to date can have signi‚Ä¶</a>

Code-to-Cloud is a portal-based experience that takes an app-first approach to building, deploying, and running your apps. Code-to-Cloud makes it easier for developers to get started using Azure, without needing to be an expert on the hundreds of different cloud services.¬†
¬†
Detect the right Azure services from your repository
¬†

¬†
Code-to-Cloud lets you connect your GitHub repositories to Azure, and through analysis of the code inside your GitHub repository, suggests the correct Azure services you should use. Once you deploy, GitHub Actions is used to create a continuous deployment pipeline between your¬†repositories and your newly provisioned cloud services.¬†Once you&#x27;ve deployed your app via Code-to-Cloud, changes to your code will immediately be pushed to your connected Azure services.¬†
¬†
Bring your own repository or start from a template
¬†

¬†
Code-to-Cloud also provides sample templates, powered by Azure Developer CLI, that provide a helpful blueprint for getting started with Azure. You can use these templates to immediately create a GitHub repository, connect it to Azure, and provision a distinct set of services for the template scenario. Our templates include sample static websites, web apps, and APIs, in a variety of different languages.
¬†
Manage your app in a consolidated view
¬†

¬†
¬†
In addition to making it easier and faster to get started developing, Code-to-Cloud also provides a simplified, app-centric management experience. A &quot;Space&quot; is a loose collection of cloud services that, collectively, comprise the app you are building. You can manage your compute, database, caching, and other key services all within the same, easy-to-use management experience.
¬†
To get started immediately, you can check out Code-to-Cloud¬†here. You can also read our documentation to get a better look at what Code-to-Cloud can do for you.</a>

As customers collect larger sets of sensitive data, they require a solution that provides defense in depth, helping them keep their data secure. Since our initial preview in May 2021, we have seen tremendous excitement from customers who build solutions to process sensitive data. Our platform has empowered users to manage sensitive data while creating diverse scenarios including multiparty data analytics, ML inferencing, and data processing.

Today we‚Äôre announcing the preview release of two new features for Azure Container Apps (ACA) related to service management

An alternative hosting option for runtime services
Prior to today&#x27;s announcement user&#x27;s options for runtime services was a choice between Azure managed services (such as Azure Cache for Redis), or self-hosting the service as an ACA app (typically using an open-source version). Now there&#x27;s another option through add-ons. Add-ons are Microsoft curated containers that are intended for development use where the full enterprise-grade quality of Azure managed services is not needed.

Add-ons start quickly and share many of the same features as ACA apps themselves - such as scaling down to zero when not be‚Ä¶</a>

That‚Äôs why we so often spend so much effort to optimize the time between ‚ÄúFile Save‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrowser Reload‚Äù. A lot of time this loop happens entirely on our workstations, and we forgo the true end-to-end test of reviewing our changes on the platform that will later run the application -- doing so usually takes too long.

This gap between developing and running an application is often also the reason we rarely keep our applications up to date. Once an app is running and we‚Äôve moved on to the next project, it‚Äôs often too tedious to come back. We need to switch context, reopen an old project we barely remember, just to check if there‚Äôs been an update to any of the components we‚Äôve used. If t‚Ä¶</a>

Cloud-native apps are often composed of distributed microservices hosted in containers for solutions that are loosely coupled, resilient, manageable, and observable as defined by the¬†Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Event-driven applications are designed to respond to events that occur in real-time or near real-time. Events can be triggered by various sources such as user interactions, system events, sensor data, or other applications. ¬†

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/git-migration-completed/>We are proud to announce that the migration to Git packaging succeeded! ü•≥
Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!
Package sources are now available on GitLab. Note that the bugtracker is still flyspray and that merge requests are not accepted as of now. 
We intend to open the issue tracker and merge requests on the Gitlab package repos in the near future.
Mirrors are syncing again, but it may take a bit of time until your mirror of choice has caught up.
For users
Update your system and merge the pacman pacnew /etc/pacman.conf.pacnew file. This is required as we have moved the [community] repository into [extra].
$ pacman -Syu &quot;pacman&gt;&#x3D;6.0.2-7&quot;

For users of the now deprecated asp tool, you will need to switch to pkgctl:
$ pacman -Syu &quot;devtools&gt;&#x3D;1:1.0.0-1&quot;
$ pkgctl repo clone linux

For some more detailed instructions on how to obtain PKGBUILDs see the corresponding wiki article.
For packagers
Before starting, first uninstall devtools-git-poc and remove any repos from your filesystem that you cloned during the git proof-of-concept testing.
Make sure you have both, an updated devtools and pacman on your system:
$ pacman -Syu &quot;devtools&gt;&#x3D;1:1.0.0-1&quot; &quot;pacman&gt;&#x3D;6.0.2-7&quot;

Additionally clean up old chroots in /var/lib/archbuild/
$ rm -rf /var/lib/archbuild/
# or optionally, use the --clean option for pkgctl build *ONCE*
$ pkgctl build --clean

For instruction on how to use pkgctl, please take a look at the &quot;How to be a packager&quot; wiki article and also consult the man page of each subcommand for further information:
$ man pkgctl-build
$ man pkgctl-repo-clone</a>

As with every article in this series this has been driven by customer use cases. In this instance the customer desired having a development web application on a public domain but ring fenced to only allow access to authenticated users from Azure AD.

Before we dive deeper into the use case and implementation its important to understand the various components if unfamiliar. I will speak about benefits of certain technologies as I go through but it is worth taking a quick look at these links as a level set if you need it:
