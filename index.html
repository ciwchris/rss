              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/06/210624114334.htm>Researchers fed fruit flies antibiotics and monitored the lifetime activity of hundreds of genes that scientists have traditionally thought control aging. To their surprise, the antibiotics not only extended the lives of the flies but also dramatically changed the activity of many of these genes. Their results suggested that only about 30% of the genes traditionally associated with aging set an animal&#x27;s internal clock while the rest reflect the body&#x27;s response to bacteria.</a>

              How childhood exercise could maintain and promote cognitive function in later life

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/06/210618134038.htm>People who are physically active during childhood have higher cognitive functions in later life. Participants who exercised when they were children did better on cognitive tests regardless of their current age. However, no such relationship was found between task performance and post-childhood exercise -- suggesting that exercise during childhood is particularly important for brain development and long-term cognitive health.</a>

Slightly sour foods or drinks such as yogurt and lemon juice are yummy to many, but such highly sour foods as spoiled milk are yucky, even dangerous. Like humans, many other animals, including insects, prefer slightly acidic over very acidic foods.</a>

The study revealed the same clones occupied the same social positions in each enclosure, regardless of living conditions, providing evidence that popularity is heritable.</a>
