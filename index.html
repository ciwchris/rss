This structure is designed to adapt compute options to individual apps and microservices components for more flexible microservices solutions. Azure Container Apps now supports a Dedicated plan in addition to the existing serverless Consumption plan.
¬†
The Dedicated plan guarantees single tenancy and specialized compute options including memory-optimized choices. In addition, the new Dedicated plan runs in the same Azure Container Apps environment as the serverless Consumption plan. This allows apps or microservice components that may have different resource requirements depending on component purpose or development stack to run in the same Azure Container Apps environment.¬† An‚Ä¶</a>

What is WordPress Multisite?
¬†
WordPress Multisite is a feature of WordPress that enables you to run and manage multiple WordPress websites using the same WordPress installation. You could update multiple websites in a single click by using the parent WordPress dashboard, and even manage individual sites through their individual dashboards. This feature was previously called WordPress Multi-User.
¬†
For example, a multinational e-commerce store can create multiple country-specific subsites in the same WordPress installation using this feature. The root admin can install plugins and themes required for all the websites at once. They can also assign different admins to each subsite.

2. Modify the default site config - You would need to make a copy of the existing configuration and place the file inside the¬†/home/site¬†directory by running the below command.
¬†
¬†
cp /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf /home/site/default
¬†
¬†
¬†

¬†

Go to https://.scm.azurewebsites.net/newui/fileManager click on Modify site/default file.

    server_name example.com;

    return 301 $scheme://www.example.com$request_uri;

}

However, the module worked fine on my local environment, single virtual machine, or single-instance app service.
¬†
This behavior occurs because Node-Cache and other private cache solutions are designed to store data in the memory of a single process. The private cache works properly when running on a single instance, as all requests are handled by the same process and have access to the same cache.
¬†

However, in a multi-instance environment like a multi-instance App Service, using a private cache can lead to inconsistent behavior and data inconsistency.

For example, you save a value in one cache in an instance. Then, a request tries to read th‚Ä¶</a>

Listening
Gift from the Trees by Mammal Hands

I am still really loving the constellation of bands around
Mammal Hands. They just released
a new album, ‚ÄúGift from the Trees‚Äù, and it‚Äôs really excellent.
RETURN by tAKX

Their guitarist, Stephen Mullins, also just released an excellent
album that has more of a Fennesz
direction - guitar-based ambient.
Watching
Of course I watched Succession, and it was good. I also watched
four movies - the best being Nope,
which delivered on all the levels. The rest were more uneven:
The Neon Demon is
a ‚Äúvibes movie‚Äù, Triangle of Sadness
was sort of an overdone, kind of tedious satire, and I disliked
how much I liked This is the End.
It started sometime in the pandemic, but my already-bad taste in movies
has gotten even‚Ä¶</a>

For example, you might want to enable a custom authentication process, create a sampler of your own, or design a testing element that is not yet released in the open source JMeter community.¬†
Custom plugins extend the core functionality of JMeter and may allow you to implement that custom scenario into your performance tests to fine tune your test scripts and reporting capabilities. Learn how to get more from your performance testing, using custom plugins and Azure Load Testing. ¬†

This approach allows you to have full flexibility over your database calls but building out such a backend can be tedious and complex, especially when considering the edge cases of a data-access backend such as authorization and relationships. With Static Web Apps‚Äô database connections feature, and its underlying open-source project Data API Builder, you now have more options to build out database-backed web applications. In this blog article, we cover the considerations of choosing between these various options.

MongoDB Atlas¬†and Azure are great friends! In fact, they became even better friends recently with the addition of the MongoDB Atlas Pas-as-You-Go Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription to the Azure Marketplace, allowing you to use your existing Azure credits to enjoy all the benefits of the MongoDB Atlas Developer Data Platform. So there is no better time to learn how you can take advantage of both of these.

In this article, we are going to see how you can deploy a MERN stack application to Azure Web Apps, part of Azure App Service, in a few simple steps. By the end of this, you will have your own version of the website that can be found here.

One of the best ways to do this is by collecting a network trace. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll walk you through the process of collecting a network trace on Azure Container App using the &#x60;tcpdump&#x60;¬†tool.

Step 1: Accessing the Azure Container App Console
To access the Azure Container App Console, navigate to your container app in the Azure Portal. Once you&#x27;ve selected your container app, click on the &quot;Console&quot; option under the &quot;Monitoring&quot; blade. This will open up a terminal window in your browser that you can use to connect to your container.

Step 2: Installing &#x60;tcpdump&#x60;
In case &#x60;tcpdump&#x60; is not installed on your container,¬†you can easily install it using the package ‚Ä¶</a>

In this post, I&#x27;ll walk you through the steps involved, which include:

creating an &quot;azure.yaml&quot; file via &#x60;azd init&#x60;
adding a &quot;main.parameters.json&quot; file
properly tagging your resource group and resources with &#x60;azd-env-name&#x60;
for deployment targets, add the corresponding &#x60;azd-service-name&#x60; tag as defined in &quot;azure.yaml&quot;

This plan is now in public preview so you can start creating and deploying apps today. This new plan is super-efficient because you can start from zero and scale to zero vCPU. ¬†You get more straightforward pricing across your containerized applications since it costs the same as Azure Container Apps, but with added value for Spring apps.
¬†
How does this work? With the new plan, you can deploy apps that don‚Äôt need to run all the time or apps that have bursts of traffic and only pay for the resources used. This is a ‚Äúserverless plan‚Äù, which means your apps can scale out and in automatically depending on the number of HTTP requests or events they receive or simply run as always-on background jobs.

Technology makes our life easier and helps us solve complex problems. Everyday we look for ways to automate a recurring task, integrate multiple services to build a solution that helps us develop faster.
In this article we will be introducing you to two services:

Azure - that makes handling infrastructure easy
Appwrite - that makes backend development easy

We will be showing you how to build a virtual machine in Azure, followed by installing Appwrite and building a demo with it.
First, let‚Äôs get you introduced to Appwrite and Azure.

What is Appwrite?
Appwrite¬†is a self-hosted backend-as-a-service platform that provides developers with all the core APIs required to build any application. Appwrite provides you with a set of APIs, tools, and a management console UI to help you‚Ä¶</a>

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code on-demand without having to manage infrastructure. It supports various types of triggers, including HTTP triggers, which allow you to expose your function as a RESTful API.
However, while working with Azure Function HTTP triggers, you may encounter a 404 error, which indicates that the requested resource was not found.
In this blog, we will learn the possible causes of the Azure Function HTTP trigger 404 error, along with examples to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

Causes of Azure Function HTTP Trigger 404 Error

The Azure Function HTTP trigger 404 error can occur due to various reasons, including:

This is the last in the three part sub-series looking at the newly launched Data API builder for Azure Databases (DAB) and while last time we looked at creating a React application, this time I wanted to look at how to do the same thing but in .NET using Blazor. So let&#x27;s jump in and learn about how to use SWA Data Connections with Blazor.
Oh, and for something different, let&#x27;s try also use a SQL backend rather than Cosmos DB.
Setting up DAB
When we&#x27;ve looked at DAB so far, we&#x27;ve had to create two files, a config for DAB and a GraphQL schema containing the types. Well since we&#x27;re using SQL this time we can drop the GraphQL schema file, as DAB will use the SQL schema to generate the types, something it couldn&#x27;t do fro‚Ä¶</a>

In the last post I introduced you to a new project we&#x27;ve been working on, Data API builder for Azure Databases (DAB) and in this post I want to look at how we can use it in Azure, and that will be through one of my favourite Azure services, Azure Static Web Apps, for you see, as part of the announcement today of DAB, we&#x27;ve announced that it is available as a feature of SWA (called Database Connections), so let&#x27;s build a React app!
Local Development
One of the neat things about working with SWA is that we have a CLI tool which emulates the functionality of SWA, and with today&#x27;s announcement, we can use it to emulate the Database Connections feature, so let&#x27;s get started. First off, we need to ensure we have the lates‚Ä¶</a>

I&#x27;m really excited because today we launched the first public preview of Data API builder for Azure Databases or DAB for short (the official name is a bit of a mouthful ¬≠;p).

What is DAB
DAB is a joint effort from the Azure SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Cosmos DB teams to provide a simple and easy way to create REST and GraphQL endpoints from your existing database. Now obviously this is something that you&#x27;ve always been able to do, but the difference is that DAB does it for you (after all, that&#x27;s the point of this series) so rather than having to write an ASP.NET application, data layer, authentica‚Ä¶</a>
