              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/12/27/books.html>This year I read 22 books, which is about the average for the last few years. The
ratio of fiction to non-fiction was skewed toward non-fiction. I think overall
I read fewer amazing books than last year, when I finished 20, but also fewer
duds - though there certainly were some duds. Next year as always, I want to read more
and I‚Äôll probably dive back into fiction. You can find the whole list and
reviews in the /reading section. Here are the hits.
The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn by Suleiman Osman
My review, on IndieBound
This was the best book I read this year. It tells the story of the modern era of Brooklyn - that of real estate appreciation, displacement, redevelopment and preservation, NIMBYs and Robert Moses. Osman knits together history in a way that‚Äôs compelling but doesn‚Äôt ove‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-functions-openapi-extension-update/ba-p/3702128>Since the last update of v1.4.0, this Azure Functions OpenAPI extension has a lot of improvements. Here in this post, let&#x27;s discuss what improvements have been made.
Update ‚Äì v1.5.0
.NET 7 support for the isolated worker extension
According to the Azure Functions roadmap, Azure Functions isolated worker model has started supporting .NET 7. Therefore, this OpenAPI extension also starts supporting .NET 7 with the isolated worker model. The migration step is as easy as changing the target framework. Update your .csproj file and find the  node, and change it from netcoreapp3.1 (.NET Core 3.1), net5.0 (.NET 5) or net6.0 (.NET 6), to net7.0 (.NET 7).

              Using Operation Results API to check the progress of deployment slots swap operation in App Service

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/using-operation-results-api-to-check-the-progress-of-deployment/ba-p/3641831>Currently there is no standard REST API to monitor swap operation, apart from using the activity logs.¬†
¬†
Web Apps - Swap Slot Slot - REST API (Azure App Service) | Microsoft Docs
¬†
However, we have recently found the following way to monitor the Swap operation and the same API is being used by Azure portal as well to update the Swap status and it&#x27;s comparatively fast. Please refer to the steps below:
¬†

First call the POST Slot-Swap API &amp; it will trigger the swap operation as shown below:

https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/slotsswap?api-version&#x3D;2022-03-01
¬†
¬†

¬†
2. The above API will have location parameter in Response Headers with Operation Results API call which can be used to continuously poll in a loop until the Response is 200 (Swap completed) or (failure status code in case of swap failure)
¬†
GET: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/operationresults/915677b6-ea92-44c9-865b-95cfc693d5bb?api-version&#x3D;2018-11-01
¬†
Polling: Swap in accepted/in-progress state:
¬†

¬†
Polling: Swap completed:
¬†

¬†
Thanks to¬†@DeependraChaudhary¬†for sharing the approach.

Azure Load Testing support for private endpoint load testing is currently available in seven regions with expansion on the horizon.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/12/01/recently.html>November was another packed month of travel, work, and making the most
of New York before the snow takes over.
Reading
I finally finished Barbarian Days.
I think it took over a month to get through it - kept losing momentum by
taking a few days off from reading during a trip. It was good - of course
it was good, it won a Pulitzer. I enjoyed it, but I wish I enjoyed reading it more,
and I‚Äôm not sure why.
There have been hundreds of articles written about Twitter and FTX this month.
I read a lot of both, and none of the FTX articles particularly stuck out,
but jwz‚Äôs writing has been a fun way to follow
along with some of the Mastodon/Twitter hype. That‚Äôs jwz of Mozilla, Netscape Navigator, and DNA Lounge.
Nick Maggiulli‚Äôs How Much Growth Can You Expect?
was an interesting read, but even moreso I appreciate that all of his
analysis is open source on GitHub
and serves as a neat example learning a bit of R.
Listening

Not a big month for new music, the only thing that really hooked me in November was
Pavane pour une infante d√©funte by Maurice Ravel.
I‚Äôm trying to learn it on guitar (like most classical, there‚Äôs a great tab
on classtab), but the original version on piano is so lovely.
Watching

Serial Mom was, I think, the first John
Waters film I‚Äôve watched. Made me want to watch more from the back catalog.

I‚Äôm continuing the mission of watching all the Nic Cage films - at
18% so far - with Matchstick Men.
It‚Äôs one of the good ones.
Finished Only Murders in The Building,
which has a sort of extreme mass-appeal quality that‚Äôs become more boring than
appealing lately.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220509171056.htm>Researchers describe a novel form of gene regulation that is altered in bladder cancer, leading to the boosting of a gene pathway that helps the cancer cells survive during rapid growth. The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220509100931.htm>Young adults who were at risk of food insecurity had increased incidence of diabetes 10 years later, according to a new study. While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they&#x27;d been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.</a>

Now scientists have shown that the same may be true for cells, uncovering a newly-discovered mechanism that might help prevent the build-up of tangles of proteins commonly seen in dementia. Scientists have identified a new mechanism that appears to reverse the build-up of aggregates, not by eliminating them completely, but rather by &#x27;refolding&#x27; them.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220504110405.htm>Substituting 20 % of meat from cattle with microbial protein -- a meat alternative produced in fermentation tanks -- by 2050 could halve deforestation, a new analysis finds. The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population&#x27;s increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220504082622.htm>In the search for eternal youth, fecal transplants may seem like an unlikely way to reverse the aging process. However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.</a>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220421100149.htm>Dentures may have a potentially negative impact on a person&#x27;s overall nutrition, according to new research. The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals&#x27; overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.</a>

Three slices of bread or one teaspoon of table salt will do it, and chances are your daily sodium intake is far greater. More than 90% of Americans consume too much sodium, which can lead to hypertension, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. A new article provides a comprehensive review of scientific literature on sodium reduction strategies in food production.</a>
