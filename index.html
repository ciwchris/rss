¬†
As with every article in this series this has been driven by customer use cases. In this instance the customer desired having a development web application on a public domain but ring fenced to only allow access to authenticated users from Azure AD.
¬†
Before we dive deeper into the use case and implementation its important to understand the various components if unfamiliar. I will speak about benefits of certain technologies as I go through but it is worth taking a quick look at these links as a level set if you need it:

I have decided to create a series of blogs covering some of the common ways to increase cluster security. I have plans for blog posts regarding Azure AD user authentication on micro services, utilizing Open Service Mesh and Network Policies to implement internal cluster networking security and the different options regarding metrics, alerting and telemetry for AKS clusters.

              Git migration announcement
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 348 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/git-migration-announcement/>This Friday morning (2023-05-19) the Git packaging migration will start until Sunday (2023-05-21). The Arch Linux packaging team will not be able to update packages in any of the repositories during this period.
Notification when the migration starts, and when it is completed, will be published on the [arch-dev-public] mailing list.
How does this impact Arch Linux users?
The [testing] repository will be split into [core-testing] and [extra-testing], the [staging] repository will be split into [core-staging] and [extra-staging]. The [community] repository will be merged into [extra] and will therefore be empty after the migration.
All affected repositories will be provided as empty repositories for a transition period after the migration. For regular users, this means that everything works as before.
Note: After the migration is done, users that have the testing repositories enabled need to include the new repositories ([core-testing] and [extra-testing] instead of [testing]) in their pacman.conf before updating their system.
Other changes:
SVN access is discontinued and will dissappear.
The svn2git mirror will no longer be updated.
asp, which relies on the svn2git mirror, will stop working. It is replaced by pkgctl repo clone.
How does this impact Arch Linux tier 1 mirrors?
During the migration rsync and HTTP access will be shut down. We will send an email notification to arch-mirrors once everything has been finished.
How does this impact Arch Linux packagers?
Packagers will not be able to patch and update their packages. The internal Tier 0 mirror is also going to be disabled for the duration of this migration.</a>

Customers may want to list all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoints, and enable Network Security Group for the Private Endpoints.
There is no way to do it from Azure portal. But the below Power shell script can help customers list all the subnets used for¬†Private Endpoints.

List all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoint using PowerShell script

$privateEndpoints &#x3D; Get-AzPrivateEndpoint
$subnetIds &#x3D; $privateEndpoints | ForEach-Object { $_.Subnet.Id }
$uniqueSubnetIds &#x3D; $subnetIds | Sort-Object -Unique
¬†
foreach ($subnetId in $uniqueSubnetIds) {

}

The output is like this¬†

How To Enable Network Security Group for Private Endpoints¬†
By default, network policies are disabled for a subnet in a virtual network.
You need to assign the NSG name first in this subnet, then enable NSG in ‚ÄúNetwork Policy for Private Endpoint‚Äù, then the PE will be applied the NSG rule.

As we want our application to be fully-managed and scaling automatically in the cloud, MongoDB Atlas is a great choice for our data store since it‚Äôs a fully-managed, cloud-native database as a service that can also scale up and down automatically in a cost-effective way to meet the needs of any application.

Set up less than 3 custom DNS servers.¬†


¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses the¬†CoreDNS¬†project for cluster DNS management and resolution. Based on observation, it only takes the first three custom DNS server settings. If you specify more than three custom DNS servers, AKS will only use the first three.¬†

Having the ability to identify clear root cause for incidents in production workloads is valuable, the best way to prevent future incidents is to understand what caused past ones. Of course you can have a good set of load tests but still, incidents in production environments can happen and it&#x27;s crucial to have available data that can help to understand what happened so application can be improved and prevent replications.
In this article we will learn how to use Application Insights and automatic profiler to find root cause for past incidents and prepare logging platform to ensure meaningful data for analysis.
