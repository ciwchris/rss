              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/01/28/placemark.html>Yesterday, I announced that I was joining Val.town, but that Placemark lived. And I haven‚Äôt really given an update on Placemark, the product and business, in a while. Writing about an operating business is a different thing that writing feature announcements or essays about technology: the ramifications of honesty, spin, or disclosure are so much more vast and unpredictable. This is why we often learn about people‚Äôs trials or a company‚Äôs struggles only years later, but at the time everyone exudes confidence.
But, having drafted something about this a few times and edited myself into knots, I figure it‚Äôs better to just write something. The best writing always comes after I‚Äôve scrapped a draft anyway.
The company behind Placemark, Working Idea LLC, is still a bootstrapped, single-person enti‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/01/27/valtown.html>Last week I joined val.town as Steve Krouse‚Äôs cofounder. Val.town is a system for programming in the small, for writing short programs in TypeScript that can link together into something larger. It‚Äôs for writing that scheduled web scraper or basic API that you wanted to make but didn‚Äôt want to add to your pile of servers on AWS or GCP. It‚Äôs already a lot of fun to use, and is going to keep getting better.

Placemark lives. It‚Äôs still getting better every week. It‚Äôs been about two years since I formally started it, and it‚Äôs grown into a great product with the help of supportive and creative customers. I‚Äôve been relatively quiet about Placemark-the-business, despite writing a steady flow of blog posts on features &amp; improvements on placemark.io. But, soon - I‚Äôll publish a state of Placemark in the near future.
I‚Äôm tremendously excited about Val.town. It‚Äôs a small team in Brooklyn and Seattle, with lots of creative energy. I think we‚Äôll be able to take this opportunity and make something great, something that in retrospect always should have existed.</a>

Behind the scenes, it runs on a managed Kubernetes cluster and includes several open source components, including Dapr for microservices creation and execution, Envoy Proxy for ingress functions, and KEDA for event-driven autoscaling. Again, you do not have to install these components yourself. All you need to do is enable and/or configure your container app to use these components.

In this blog, we will see how can we scale Container Apps based on Redis Streams with the Azure managed instance of Redis, i.e. Azure Cache for Redis.¬†We will be¬†referring to the KEDA trigger specification for Redis Streams (Scale applications based on Redis Streams) to configure our Container App.¬†This specification describes the Redis-s‚Ä¶</a>

Some of you may have learned about these new storage providers during the annual Build conference and/or from this preview announcement blog post.
¬†
Durable Functions enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the serverless Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. We believe the new storage providers will enable a host of new scenarios for apps using Durable Functions because they allow apps to run at a higher scale, with greater price-performance efficiency, and with more portability compared to the default option Azure Storage.

Going about designing the authentication flow can be confusing and not straightforward. When load testing an application, this generally is the first step in the user journey. ¬†Supplying client credentials through a UI is not possible when load testing an application, so is evaluating how to implement specific authentication flows available on Azure, as they can be tedious and time consuming as well.
Within this series, we will cover the authentication flows and scenarios that are possible with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the identity provider.
At the end of the blog, you will be able to

Use Azure AD to Authenticate a web application hosted on Azure App Service using the client credential grant flow.

Cloud computing revolutionized how a business can establish its digital presence. Nowadays, by leveraging cloud features such as scalability, elasticity, and convenience, businesses can deploy, grow, or test an environment in every corner of the world without worrying about building the required infrastructure.
¬†
Unlike the traditional model, which was based on notifying the service provider to set up the resources for customers in advance, in an on-demand model, cloud providers implement application programming interfaces (API) that can be used by customers to deploy resources on demand. This allows the customer to access an unlimited amount of resources on-demand and only pay for the resources they use without worrying about th‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/php-82-update-and-introduction-of-legacy-branch/>The php packages have been updated to the latest version 8.2. In
addition to this, a new set of php-legacy packages have been
introduced. These will follow the oldest but still actively supported
PHP branch. This enables users to install the latest version but also
introduces the option to use third party applications that might rely
on an older version. Both branches will be kept up to date following
our rolling release model. php and php-legacy can be installed at the
same time as the latter uses a -legacy suffix for its binaries and
configuration files.
In addition to this, the php7 packages have been removed as they
reached end of life. The imap extension will no longer be provided as
it relies on the c-client library which has been abandoned for many
years.</a>

              How to use PHP8 for App Service Windows
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9470 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-use-php8-for-app-service-windows/ba-p/3709106>Note that official support for PHP 8 will only be available on Linux, as a result of this¬†App Service¬†will only support PHP 8 on¬†Apps Service Linux instances.¬†For additional information on this topic:¬†PHP on App Service,¬†php.internals: Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows.
¬†
This article will demonstrate on how to use PHP 8 for App Service Windows, since there would be no official support from Microsoft for it, please use at your own risk.
¬†
Generally, we are following this post:¬†How to use a Custom PHP runtime for App Service Windows - (azureossd.github.io)¬†to download a custom PHP runtime and map Handler for it.
¬†
1. Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.

¬†
2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:

¬†
3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from¬†PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases¬†and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:
¬†
¬†
mkdir php
curl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\php.zip
cd php
unzip php.zip
¬†
¬†


¬†
4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is &quot;*.php&quot;, the¬†Script processor is &quot;C:\home\php\php-cgi.exe&quot;. Then save it. All the configuration is done.

¬†
5. To verify it, we can create an¬†&quot;index.php&quot; file under C:\home\site\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:
¬†
&lt;?
phpinfo();
¬†
¬†

¬†
I hope you enjoy it.</a>

There is a solution - Docker Compose. However, it is still in Preview status, so it is not recommended to use it in Production environment. There are also some limitations. In this article, I would like to use a sample app service to introduce a method to do the same thing by using nginx and custom docker container.
¬†
Note
The current method does not obey the recommendation of Docker that a docker container should host only one service, and we actually recommend customers use Azure Container App for hosting multiple applications.
¬†
Design
We will create a Docker container to have nginx installed and use it as a reverse proxy to redirect the request from external to different applications.

It started 4 years ago when ACR added support for Helm Chart distribution using the existing registry services users have already configured for their secure environments. We knew Helm adoption would require support across all registries which initiated the OCI Artifacts and ORAS projects.

The time taken for a sample Node application to Azure App Service was 50mins to an hour for completing the deployment, that was triggered using GitHub Action Workflow.
The screenshot below shows the total duration for the task to complete using the default GitHub Action workflow:

To help mitigate the problem for reducing the deployment time significantly I have added the following steps in the GitHub Action workflow. Please note as I am using the ubuntu-latest OS to run the GitHub Action so there might be different method for file compression¬†when using a different OS.

But what if you want to test the system to make sure it can handle a desired number of requests per second (RPS)¬†? For example, you may want to load test a payment gateway service for the number of transactions that can be processed every second. RPS or throughput is a crucial metric that reveals fundamental information about the tested system. Every system has a critical point in terms of throughput. Once the system reaches the critical point, it might keep the throughput around the same level, but the response times go up¬† or the requests get throttled.

Reading
This month‚Äôs theme, looking back on it, was feminism, and so I read
Bad Sex, which was
on quite a few best-of-2022 lists. It was fine, but mostly whetted
my appetite for the books that it referenced. The
Right to Sex on
the other hand, was a perfect sort of thought-provoking thesis that
explored a bunch of surprising topics with a lot of intellectual
power.
I‚Äôve been experimenting with switching from my usual setup -

which does both, and more. Readwise feels flashy and has an
