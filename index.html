After Microsoft ODBC Driver version 17.3.1.1, we will able to use the system-assigned and user-assigned identities (Using Azure Active Directory with the ODBC Driver - ODBC Driver for SQL Server | Microsoft Learn) to access the Azure SQL Server

Microsoft ODBC driver version in Azure Web App for PHP 8.1~ in Linux is after this version. We could run below command to check:

odbcinst -j
cat /etc/odbcinst.ini

The result could see we have both ODBC 17 and ODBC 18 driver. And both version is greater than the 17.3.1.1. So it shall support to use the system-assigned managed identity to access the Azure SQL database

Performance testing is not always a walk in the park. Quite often, it can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex and dynamic web applications that rely on JavaScript, AJAX, or other browser-side technologies.
For testing browser latencies under heavy load, JMeter has a built-in component called Web Driver Sampler, which allows testers to use Selenium WebDriver to simulate real browser actions and interactions with web elements. Web Driver Sampler can complement the HTTP Request Sampler, which sends HTTP requests to the server, by adding the browser-side perspective and measuring the rendering time, page load time, and user actions. By running JMeter scripts on Azure Load Testing, you can reliably execute your performance tests without worrying ‚Ä¶</a>

              Automatic Memory Fit for Java Apps in Azure Container Apps
              <span class="post-metadata">(31 min | 9279 words)</span>

Containerization has become the prevailing choice for hosting and managing Java applications, due to its unmatched portability, consistency, and scalability benefits. However, by default, when running a Java app inside containers, the JVM assumes that the OS memory is shared among multiple applications, so it conservatively claims memory for the Java application.
With Azure Container Apps, we can optimize memory allocation by simply dedicating more memory to the Java app, since only one Java application can run inside a container. This feature is called automatic memory fit, which is enabled by default when you deploy from Java source code or artifact.
In this blog we‚Äôll cover the following:

              How to Refresh Expired Keys in Redis using Azure Functions

Redis is an extremely popular in-memory data store that is used as a cache, session store, message broker, and more. One of the features that makes Redis really useful is the ability to set a time-to-live (TTL) value for any key. A key with a TTL value will be automatically deleted from Redis when the TTL expires. This helps reduce memory usage and ensure data freshness.
¬†
For instance, you might be storing information like inventory or pricing for your e-commerce site in Redis. This is a perfect application for caching in Redis. This type of data will be queried constantly and serving it directly from a database will either slow down your application or make your database implementation very expensive to handle the load! Using a CDN is out of the question because pricing and ‚Ä¶</a>

There are a lot of considerations one must deal with while planning, deploying and using these connections such as which identity do I use, what network configurations do I implement and where do I storage the connection configuration either in key vault or in App Configuration service to name a few.
Following these practices is important to ensure that as a developer you play your part in not just implementing best practices but also align with azure security baseline and the concept of zero trust.
This is where a service connection can help simplify some of these design and implementation choices for you.

What is it
When a user authenticates to an app (e.g., MS Entra ID application), a custom claims provider can be used to add claims into the token. A custom claims provider is made up of a custom authentication extension that calls an external REST API (e.g., a Function App), to fetch claims from external systems (e.g., a Database). A custom claims provider can be assigned to one or many applications.
¬†
Claim: Please imagine it as features (or attributes) that belong to the end user. As it may involve sensitive information within the enterprise, the enterprise owner wishes to store this user information in the on-premises environment, while also hoping to retrieve and utilize it through the authentication process.

In this article we will focus on scaling azure web apps and how the new automatic scaling feature of azure app service, which allows it to scale out and in, in response to HTTP web traffic against your web app is a great feature which further enhances cost savings and improves the availability and resiliency of your web application under conditions of load.
We will also try to understand how automatic scaling is different (and at times based on scenarios better) than rule scaling, how to better understand and configure scaling limits and how it impacts scaling of different web applications sharing the same app service plan.

              Public Preview: App Insights integration for Python apps on App Service
              <span class="post-metadata">(29 min | 8757 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/public-preview-app-insights-integration-for-python-apps-on-app/ba-p/4127818>The Azure Monitor and App Service teams are happy to share that Application Insights integration with App Services for Python apps is now available for Public Preview. You can now easily monitor your Python apps on App Service without changing your code by leveraging auto-instrumentation that is integrated into the App Services platform.
¬†
This integration supports App Service deploy as code for Python versions 3.11 and lower. Deploy as container scenarios are not currently supported, but we plan to introduce this capability at a future date. We also plan to support Python 3.12 in the near future.
¬†
With this feature enabled, the App Service platform will instrument popular Python libraries in your code and automatically channel correlated application-level logs, metrics, and distributed tracing to your Application Insights resource. This will allow you to understand how your Python application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.
¬†
You can enable the feature at resource creation or from the App Insights blade after your App Service resource is created. Please review our documentation to learn more.
¬†
Turn On App Insights during App Service Resource Creation
¬†
When you create a new Python web application (version 3.11 and lower) using the &quot;Deploy as code&quot; option, you can select &quot;Yes&quot; on the &quot;Enable Application Insights&quot; in the &quot;Monitoring&quot;¬†tab. If you select &quot;Yes&quot;, then your non-containerized Python application will pipe data to an Application Insights resource allowing you to automatically monitor your workloads.
¬†

¬†
¬†
Turn On App Insights after App Service Resource Creation
¬†
Open your App Service application in the portal and go to the App Insights menu item.

Select &quot;Enable&quot; in the toggle under &quot;Application Insights (Preview)&quot;
Select a location for your Application Insights resource (It‚Äôs suggested to create the resource in the same region as the Web App.)</a>

Over at the Val Town Blog, I wrote about how searching source code is a pretty
hard problem. It was pretty
well-received: I confirmed that yes, it‚Äôs a pretty hard problem. We‚Äôre really
trying not to write a search engine, but it‚Äôs tempting, maybe just
to tinker with Tantivy.

This is a big year for running, so far. My first race of the year is
complete - the Brooklyn Half Marathon. I ran 1:36:21 (7:21/mi pace) ‚Äì
a time that just squeaks past my previous personal best. Felt pretty good!
My pacing was good until it wasn‚Äôt: need to work on endurance past the eleven
mile mark.
I have two 5Ks lined up, but might try running another longer race,
because beating my half marathon PR seems more achievable than
beating my 5K PR, whic‚Ä¶</a>

Advanced Account Security
On select pages, Kagi will now ask you to confirm with your password or 2FA code (if configured) where sensitive actions or information may be present. This primarily applies to billing-related areas, such as accessing your invoices or switching plans.

This concludes a small arc of changes, with 2FA, QR login, and now these extra security checks. We hope these are working well for you! We&#x27;ll continue building more supported login methods, and session management tools.

Serving as a localized DNS service, it supersedes mappings provided by external DNS servers, enhancing efficiency in local domain resolution. Its location varies according to the operating system utilized. Failure to retrieve IP addresses from a locally installed server or resolve them through DNS can result in application startup issues, underscoring the critical role of the hosts file in network connectivity.

In this article, we&#x27;ll show you how LangChain.js, Ollama with Mistral 7B model and Azure can be used together to build a serverless chatbot that can answer questions using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. We&#x27;ll see first how you can work fully locally to develop and test your chatbot, and then deploy it to the cloud with state-of-the-art OpenAI models.
