Cloud computing revolutionized how a business can establish its digital presence. Nowadays, by leveraging cloud features such as scalability, elasticity, and convenience, businesses can deploy, grow, or test an environment in every corner of the world without worrying about building the required infrastructure.
¬†
Unlike the traditional model, which was based on notifying the service provider to set up the resources for customers in advance, in an on-demand model, cloud providers implement application programming interfaces (API) that can be used by customers to deploy resources on demand. This allows the customer to access an unlimited amount of resources on-demand and only pay for the resources they use without worrying about th‚Ä¶</a>

              PHP 8.2 update and introduction of legacy branch
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 236 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/php-82-update-and-introduction-of-legacy-branch/>The php packages have been updated to the latest version 8.2. In
addition to this, a new set of php-legacy packages have been
introduced. These will follow the oldest but still actively supported
PHP branch. This enables users to install the latest version but also
introduces the option to use third party applications that might rely
on an older version. Both branches will be kept up to date following
our rolling release model. php and php-legacy can be installed at the
same time as the latter uses a -legacy suffix for its binaries and
configuration files.
In addition to this, the php7 packages have been removed as they
reached end of life. The imap extension will no longer be provided as
it relies on the c-client library which has been abandoned for many
years.</a>

              How to use PHP8 for App Service Windows
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9470 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-use-php8-for-app-service-windows/ba-p/3709106>Note that official support for PHP 8 will only be available on Linux, as a result of this¬†App Service¬†will only support PHP 8 on¬†Apps Service Linux instances.¬†For additional information on this topic:¬†PHP on App Service,¬†php.internals: Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows.
¬†
This article will demonstrate on how to use PHP 8 for App Service Windows, since there would be no official support from Microsoft for it, please use at your own risk.
¬†
Generally, we are following this post:¬†How to use a Custom PHP runtime for App Service Windows - (azureossd.github.io)¬†to download a custom PHP runtime and map Handler for it.
¬†
1. Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.

¬†
2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:

¬†
3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from¬†PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases¬†and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:
¬†
¬†
mkdir php
curl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\php.zip
cd php
unzip php.zip
¬†
¬†


¬†
4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is &quot;*.php&quot;, the¬†Script processor is &quot;C:\home\php\php-cgi.exe&quot;. Then save it. All the configuration is done.

¬†
5. To verify it, we can create an¬†&quot;index.php&quot; file under C:\home\site\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:
¬†
&lt;?
phpinfo();
¬†
¬†

¬†
I hope you enjoy it.</a>

Jonathon was an active participant and contributor to Arch Linux, several derived distributions, the AUR and through personal repositories. He was enthusiastic, helpful and eager to contribute towards improving the free and open source software community as a whole.
On behalf of the wider Arch Linux community, our condolences go out to his family and friends.</a>

There is a solution - Docker Compose. However, it is still in Preview status, so it is not recommended to use it in Production environment. There are also some limitations. In this article, I would like to use a sample app service to introduce a method to do the same thing by using nginx and custom docker container.
¬†
Note
The current method does not obey the recommendation of Docker that a docker container should host only one service, and we actually recommend customers use Azure Container App for hosting multiple applications.
¬†
Design
We will create a Docker container to have nginx installed and use it as a reverse proxy to redirect the request from external to different applications.

The update continues the journey of standardizing OCI Distribution-based registries to store, discover and distribute all types of artifacts, including adding references to existing images and other OCI artifacts.
¬†
It started 4 years ago when ACR added support for Helm Chart distribution using the existing registry services users have already configured for their secure environments. We knew Helm adoption would require support across all registries which initiated the OCI Artifacts and ORAS projects.

As supply chain initiatives drove the need for distributing detached signatures for container images and signed Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), reference types were needed to add information to the registr‚Ä¶</a>

              How to reduce the deployment time using the file compression technique in Azure App Service

The time taken for a sample Node application to Azure App Service was 50mins to an hour for completing the deployment, that was triggered using GitHub Action Workflow.
The screenshot below shows the total duration for the task to complete using the default GitHub Action workflow:

¬†
To help mitigate the problem for reducing the deployment time significantly I have added the following steps in the GitHub Action workflow. Please note as I am using the ubuntu-latest OS to run the GitHub Action so there might be different method for file compression¬†when using a different OS.

But what if you want to test the system to make sure it can handle a desired number of requests per second (RPS)¬†? For example, you may want to load test a payment gateway service for the number of transactions that can be processed every second. RPS or throughput is a crucial metric that reveals fundamental information about the tested system. Every system has a critical point in terms of throughput. Once the system reaches the critical point, it might keep the throughput around the same level, but the response times go up¬† or the requests get throttled.

Recently.
Reading
This month‚Äôs theme, looking back on it, was feminism, and so I read
Bad Sex, which was
on quite a few best-of-2022 lists. It was fine, but mostly whetted
my appetite for the books that it referenced. The
Right to Sex on
the other hand, was a perfect sort of thought-provoking thesis that
explored a bunch of surprising topics with a lot of intellectual
power.
I‚Äôve been experimenting with switching from my usual setup -
Feedbin for RSS and Instapaper
for read-it-later, in favor of Readwise Reader,
which does both, and more. Readwise feels flashy and has an

ratio of fiction to non-fiction was skewed toward non-fiction. I think overall
I read fewer amazing books than last year, when I finished 20, but also fewer
duds - though there certainly were some duds. Next year as always, I want to read more
and I‚Äôll probably dive back into fiction. You can find the whole list and
reviews in the /reading section. Here are the hits.
The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn by Suleiman Osman

Here in this post, let&#x27;s discuss what improvements have been made.
Update ‚Äì v1.5.0
.NET 7 support for the isolated worker extension
According to the Azure Functions roadmap, Azure Functions isolated worker model has started supporting .NET 7. Therefore, this OpenAPI extension also starts supporting .NET 7 with the isolated worker model. The migration step is as easy as changing the target framework. Update your .csproj file and find the  node, and change it from netcoreapp3.1 (.NET Core 3.1), net5.0 (.NET 5) or net6.0 (.NET 6), to net7.0 (.NET 7).

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220429145059.htm>Scientists pinpoint the molecular epicenter of deep-sleep regulation. The findings, based on research in mice, identify a gene that makes a protein that regulates delta waves -- electrical signals between neurons that occur during the deepest phases of relaxation and are a hallmark of restorative sleep.</a>
