Your PowerShell modules defined in requirements.psd1 file will be downloaded automatically if you enable¬†dependency management. However, if your Function App runs on Consumption plan and the size of dependent modules is too large, chances are the download would fail. During the installation, the modules would be unziped and saved in the &quot;D:\local\Temp&quot;, which is the temp storage on the plan worker. Due to the¬†500 MB limit¬†of temp storage on consumption plan, the installation would fail with not enough space error:

Why Debug Mode?
Debug mode is designed to help you validate your test configuration and application behavior by running a load test with a single engine for up to 10 minutes. It provides debug logs for the test script, and request and response data for every failed request during the test run. This mode is powerful for troubleshooting issues with your test plan configura‚Ä¶</a>

Why we use it
An increasing number of security vulnerabilities are caused by sensitive information in the source code being leaked or accidentally uploaded to open repositories GitHub, leading to the exposure of a large amount of user privacy. This information includes, but is not limited to, database credentials, app keys, etc. Traditional MySQL databases use usernames and passwords for login operations, naturally leading to the inclusion of these credentials in project configuration files. Even with proper safeguards, there remain unpredictable risks, such as hacking.

This is a great way to secure your database and ensure that only the right people have access to it.
Note: For the purpose of this article, I&#x27;m going to use Entra ID to refer to a user identity, as well as a managed identity such as a service principal, as the approach is the same in this context here.
The above linked documentation covers how you would setup the Azure resource with Entra ID as the authentication mode, so I won&#x27;t go over that here (also, you can configure that when you initial create the database, or using a Bicep script), instead I want to look at how we use that in a .NET application, because when you&#x27;re connecting using Entra ID you don&#x27;t have a pas‚Ä¶</a>

Obsidian as my note-taking application, and I found myself wanting to create
charts for certain concepts.
For example, I recently learned about the availability of mortgage discounts
from some banks in exchange for having a high balance. I am
not buying a house, but
nevertheless, these were numbers from multiple sources that could be charted
and compared and nobody was doing it, so I had to. So I made a chart:

It seems like mortgage discounts are mostly a bad idea, but now I at least have a quick visual
reference for how they work across multiple ba‚Ä¶</a>

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that lets you test the performance and scalability of your web applications and APIs. You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.
Response time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining ‚Ä¶</a>

              Simplify Your Azure Kubernetes Service Connection Configuration with Service Connector
              <span class="post-metadata">(29 min | 8610 words)</span>

Users are required to manually configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID or Managed Identities so their AKS workloads can securely access these protected resources.
The Service Connector integration greatly simplifies the connection configuration experience for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. Service Connector takes care of authentication and network configurations securely and follows Azure best practices, so you can focus on your application code without worrying about your infrastructure connectivity.

Service Connector Action Breakdown
¬†
Before, in order to connect from AKS pods to a private Azure backing services using workload identity, users needed to perform the following actions manually:

Create a managed identity
Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL
Create Kubernetes service account
Establish federated identity credential trust
Grant permissions to access Azure Services
Deploy the application

Now, Service Connector performs steps 2 to 5 automatically. Additionally, for Azure services without public access, Service Connector creates private connection components such as private link, private endpoint, DNS record,
You can create a connection in the Service Connection blade within AKS.

¬†

At last year&#x27;s KubeCon North America, Microsoft announced the adoption of Karpenter in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an alternative to the Cluster Autoscaler (CA), referred to as Node Autoprovisioning (NAP). While Cluster Autoscaler has been the default node scaler in AKS/Kubernetes, there have been significant challenges that led to the adoption of Karpenter. This post delves into these challenges and explores how Karpenter addresses them.

If you are using Safari and developer beta on iOS (17.5), Kagi Search for Safari extension may have stopped working due to a bug introduced in this iOS release last week. We have released a TestFlight version of the new version that should work. We are planning to release it to app store as soon as we get positive verification from users. It may help long term if you took a second and sent feedback to Apple to consider including Kagi as a search engine choice in Safari. Thank you üôè

¬†
CI/CD is a system that automates steps in software delivery. For WordPress developers, it means less manual work: once you push updates, the system automatically tests and deploys them. It&#x27;s like having a assistant that not only speeds up your work but also checks for errors with each update, ensuring your WordPress site runs smoothly. This constant testing and feedback loop means you can fix bugs quickly and improve your site continuously without disrupting the live version. In short, CI/CD makes your development process faster, more efficient, and less error prone.

Why do you need a staging site for your WordPress website?
A staging site is extremely useful when you are working on a WordPress website. It provides a safe area for development, testing, and experimentation. When you are trying out a new plugin, theme or custom code, there are chances that the website might break leading to downtime for your users, or even cause irreparable damage to your website like loss of content and data.

Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform that enables you to run containerized workloads without managing the underlying infrastructure. Dynamic sessions adds the ability to execute untrusted code in secure, sandboxed environments at scale.

When you build applications that run code or commands from untrusted sources, you must ensure that the code runs in its own isolated environment. Dynamic sessions provide secure, ephemeral sandboxes called &quot;sessions&quot; for running potentially malicious code. Each session runs in its own Hyper-V virtualization boundary ‚Äî ensuring complete isolation from other sessions and resources.
