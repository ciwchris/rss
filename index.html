I sincerely hope that this year brings you much success. As I was doing a perspective of last year of the value that we added for Azure Functions customers - although we shipped 100‚Äôs of small improvements - I wanted to share with all of you a recap of all the major releases and provide a sneak peek on what we are working on in this year.

Language Versions Support:¬†This year we continued on making sure that our customers have access to the latest language versions for various languages as soon as we can. We believe we have the most comprehensive¬†latest¬†support across all the major languages among all the major cloud serverless vendors. These include support for .NET 7, Python 3.10, NodeJS 18, Java 17, PowerShell 7.2 across all the SKU‚Äôs that Az‚Ä¶</a>

The update continues the journey of standardizing OCI Distribution-based registries to store, discover and distribute all types of artifacts, including adding references to existing images and other OCI artifacts.

It started 4 years ago when ACR added support for Helm Chart distribution using the existing registry services users have already configured for their secure environments. We knew Helm adoption would require support across all registries which initiated the OCI Artifacts and ORAS projects.

The time taken for a sample Node application to Azure App Service was 50mins to an hour for completing the deployment, that was triggered using GitHub Action Workflow.
The screenshot below shows the total duration for the task to complete using the default GitHub Action workflow:

To help mitigate the problem for reducing the deployment time significantly I have added the following steps in the GitHub Action workflow. Please note as I am using the ubuntu-latest OS to run the GitHub Action so there might be different method for file compression¬†when using a different OS.

But what if you want to test the system to make sure it can handle a desired number of requests per second (RPS)¬†? For example, you may want to load test a payment gateway service for the number of transactions that can be processed every second. RPS or throughput is a crucial metric that reveals fundamental information about the tested system. Every system has a critical point in terms of throughput. Once the system reaches the critical point, it might keep the throughput around the same level, but the response times go up¬† or the requests get throttled.

Reading
This month‚Äôs theme, looking back on it, was feminism, and so I read
Bad Sex, which was
on quite a few best-of-2022 lists. It was fine, but mostly whetted
my appetite for the books that it referenced. The
Right to Sex on
the other hand, was a perfect sort of thought-provoking thesis that
explored a bunch of surprising topics with a lot of intellectual
power.
I‚Äôve been experimenting with switching from my usual setup -
Feedbin for RSS and Instapaper
for read-it-later, in favor of Readwise Reader,
which does both, and more. Readwise feels flashy and has an

ratio of fiction to non-fiction was skewed toward non-fiction. I think overall
I read fewer amazing books than last year, when I finished 20, but also fewer

Here in this post, let&#x27;s discuss what improvements have been made.
Update ‚Äì v1.5.0
.NET 7 support for the isolated worker extension
According to the Azure Functions roadmap, Azure Functions isolated worker model has started supporting .NET 7. Therefore, this OpenAPI extension also starts supporting .NET 7 with the isolated worker model. The migration step is as easy as changing the target framework. Update your .csproj file and find the  node, and change it from netcoreapp3.1 (.NET Core 3.1), net5.0 (.NET 5) or net6.0 (.NET 6), to net7.0 (.NET 7).

Azure Container Apps enables developers to rapidly build and deploy microservices and containerized applications.¬† Developers can leverage the highly optimized developer productivity capabilities of Azure Container Apps without dealing with the complexity of Kubernetes, while Operators are able to provide developers with a highly productive platform but retain the ultimate control of the underlying Kubernetes cluster(s).
Common uses of Azure Container Apps include:

Deploying API endpoints
Hosting background processing applications
Handling event-driven processing
Running microservices

              Using Operation Results API to check the progress of deployment slots swap operation in App Service

¬†
Web Apps - Swap Slot Slot - REST API (Azure App Service) | Microsoft Docs
¬†
However, we have recently found the following way to monitor the Swap operation and the same API is being used by Azure portal as well to update the Swap status and it&#x27;s comparatively fast. Please refer to the steps below:
¬†

First call the POST Slot-Swap API &amp; it will trigger the swap operation as shown below:

https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/slotsswap?api-version&#x3D;2022-03-01
¬†
¬†

¬†
2. The above API will have location parameter in Response Headers with Operation Results API call which can be used to continuously poll in a loop until the Response is 200 (Swap completed) or (failure status code in case of swap failure)
¬†
GET: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/operationresults/915677b6-ea92-44c9-865b-95cfc693d5bb?api-version&#x3D;2018-11-01
¬†
Polling: Swap in accepted/in-progress state:
¬†

¬†
Polling: Swap completed:
¬†

¬†
