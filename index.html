              <a target="_blank" href=https://github.blog/changelog/2024-02-22-new-limits-on-scoped-token-creation-for-github-apps>As a proactive measure to protect Github.com availability, GitHub Apps that attempt to create high-complexity scoped installation tokens will receive failures if they would individually reference too many repositories. At the time of release, no GitHub App is above these limits ‚Äì the limit is approximately 8 times higher than what any app is consuming. [‚Ä¶]

Here, we will be creating/updating a Container App Job using Azure Python SDK, while using Service Principal for authentication. Also, we will be using an App Service to deploy our project. We will be referring to the job creation sample which is one of the many templates provided in the Azure Python SDK template list.

¬†

How do you manage the lifecycle of those APIs?
What governance would you apply to these APIs?
What is the list of environments needed to manage these APIs?
What are the deployment strategies for those APIs?
How would you integrate those APIs with other services?

¬†
As your company&#x27;s number of APIs increases, so does the complexity of managing them. Azure API Center (APIC) is a central repository for your APIs lifecycle management, and it offers the more efficient ways for management. Throughout this post, I will take a first look at what Azure API Center is and what it offers.

You can find a sample code from this GitHub repository.

Azure Function App provide Access Restriction and Private Endpoint feature to safeguard your Function App from unauthorized inbound requests.

Automatic Secret rotation solution:Based on the document (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/tutorial-rotation-dual?tabs&#x3D;azure-cli), it proposes a solution to generate new access keys on storage account and update it in the key vault based on the secret expiry time.

Cloud application development introduces unique challenges: applications are distributed, scale horizontally, communicate asynchronously, have automated deployments, and are built to handle failures resiliently. This demands a shift in both technical approach and mindset.
So Cloud Native is not about technologies, if you can do all of the above, then you are Cloud Native. You don‚Äôt have to use Kubernetes for instance, to become Cloud Native.

Discover
Discovering applications can be a challenge, especially in the case of bulk migrations of large environments potentially containing hundreds or more applications.¬†Azure Migrate¬†makes discovery of web apps, servers, and even databases simpler than ever. Just run the appropriate Azure Migrate tool in your VM or on-prem environment to generate an inventory of applications, servers, and databases.¬†

Many static sites are built using content from content management systems (CMS) into static assets and then deployed to Azure Static Web Apps. In this article, we take a look at using Wordpress on App Service as a headless CMS for a static site hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.

Evolution of traditional CMS&#x27;s to headless CMS&#x27;s

A content website generally involves 2 artifacts: the website code itself, and the articles that make up the website content. To build such websites, content management systems (CMS) are ideal tools to provide purpose-built editing experiences for content editors.

We added Wolfram|Alpha to enhance our capabilities in calculations, unit conversions, and time queries for better results. This solves a huge number of issues reported for these kind of queries as the results now come from a computational knowledge authorithy.

In the same spirit of getting answers faster, now simply starting your query with an interrogative word (what, where, who, which, when, how) or just ending it with a question mark (?) will automatically trigger Quick Answer:

              Observability on Azure Container Apps

Our systems can sometimes be a black box. We toss a request into it and get something back, but what goes on inside? Cutting through the tech jargon,¬†observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.
¬†
You might wonder, isn‚Äôt that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there‚Äôs a glitch slowing things down (that‚Äôs the¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äù). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the¬†‚ÄúWhy‚Äù).
¬†
Let‚Äôs say an app is responding slowly. We might have all these cool charts and graphs showing us the problem, but do they tell us why it‚Äôs happening? Not always.
¬†
That‚Äôs where solid observability comes in‚Ä¶</a>

While the complete implementation is still in progress, we want to provide you with a sneak peek into this upcoming feature. Moreover, we&#x27;ll guide you on how to start using it immediately (with certain restrictions) on Linux App Service. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll delve into the Sidecar pattern, its significance, and practical ways to leverage it for your applications.
What is the Sidecar Pattern
Applications and services often require related functionality, such as monitoring, logging, configuration, and networking services. These peripheral tasks can be implemented as separate components or services, built using different languages and technologies.

Durable Functions enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code.¬†

Distributed Tracing allows you to correlate operations together and track requests between services. This is especially useful for Durable Functions apps as they coordinate work across multiple services and VMs.¬†

The first implementation of Distributed Tracing supported only the .NET in-process model and the Azure Storage backend. The V1 implementation is still in an experimental state. Distributed Tracing V2, on the other hand, is not an experimental feature and supports all Durable Functions lang‚Ä¶</a>

If you want to move your WordPress website from any hosting platform to App Service, this plugin is for you. The plugin copies all your content from your existing site to a new WordPress site in App Service without impacting the existing site, so that you can verify and test your new site before making it available to visitors.

In this article, we will learn how to use the migration plugin to move your WordPress site to App Service.

Prerequisites:

The source site. This is the site which has the content that needs to be migrated. For this example, we will use https://thegourmetkitchen.online/

opposite archetypes:
The anti-capitalist tells the young worker not to trust HR and not to
buy into the idea of work as family. Your employment contract is the
only thing that binds you to your job, and that can be terminated on
either side. Arrive at 9, leave at 5. Prioritize the family.
The hustlebro tells you to wake up at 7am and get to work, and
give it your all. Hustle, and earn as much as you can, build those
connections. You can get work-life balance when you‚Äôre older, your
early 20s are the time for making that cheddar and staying
