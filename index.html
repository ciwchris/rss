              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/01/02/recently.html>I wrote a little yearly round-up over on Placemark.
I‚Äôm not one for concrete resolutions or nostalgia, so on with the usual, a Recently.
Reading
I read Policing the Open Road
on Rebecca‚Äôs suggestion. It‚Äôs an incredible book that I‚Äôll
probably re-read soon, because the central conflict that it sets out feels so thoroughly
deadlocked, unresolvable, and important - the interplay between privacy, safety, police
power, and freedom.
I don‚Äôt agree with all of it, but Jon McLoone‚Äôs explanatio of why Wolfram is not open source
resonated strongly with me. Placemark, as I‚Äôve said before, is not planning on being
open source, though components of the application will be released. Some of my reasoning
lines up with Wolfram‚Äôs pretty precisely. The central piece for me, I think, is just
what the community means - where communities come from, how they agree on what they
do, how they collect and disperse. Magical thinking around what constitutes
community and how it operates is my biggest gripe about open source ideology in this
day and age: too many people happily ignore the top-heaviness of some communities,
or don‚Äôt think about where the direction, leadership, contributions, and standards
come from.
Watching

Watch Vampire‚Äôs Kiss. That is all.
Expect to see in the new year: more, probably shorter, blog posts. More photos.
And Placemark, out in the wild.</a>

It might also be possible to have heard of or currently use oh-my-posh for your PowerShell. Azure offers Azure Cloud Shell service, which uses both Bash Shell and PowerShell by default. Therefore, if you want either oh-my-zsh or oh-my-posh, or both, you should configure it by yourself.
¬†
Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to show how to configure your shell environment for both.
¬†

This GitHub repository provides the working shell script source for your reference.

¬†
For oh-my-zsh
¬†
Let&#x27;s configure oh-my-zsh on your Azure Cloud Shell. Make sure that you see the Bash Shell prompt. If not, enter the bash command to switch your prompt to Bash.
¬†


Install oh-my-zsh.

The combination not only decreased arthritis inflammation markers in the cells but improved the production of desired proteins normally found in healthy cartilage. While still at an early stage, the findings suggest a new procedure could be developed to treat cartilage cells extracted from a patient to grow a supply of cells or a tissue to be re-implanted.</a>

These so-called &#x27;epigenetic clocks&#x27; have proved to be better predictors of lifespan and health than chronological age. In a new study, Yale researchers used one such clock, appropriately named &quot;GrimAge,&quot; to ask two questions: How much does chronic stress accelerate that biological clock? And are there ways to slow it down and extend a healthy lifespan?</a>

The idea of freely sharing creative works, to be recombined by a community, was exhilarating: I would contribute raw materials to the collective - photographs, code, writing - and recombine the works of others, in Photoshop competitions or remixes. Practically every photo I‚Äôd license as CC-BY-SA. If someone used one of my photos in their blog, I felt a little jolt of approval and recognition. It felt cool.
The same went for open source. The early communities around Drupal and Node.js were radically open source. Companies were releasing their entire products for free and writing detailed blog posts about how they figured out hard problems. Whatever trade secrets they had wer‚Ä¶</a>
