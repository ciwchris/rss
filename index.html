              Persisting Data Volumes With .NET Aspire

Recently, I&#x27;ve been building an app using .NET Aspire which I&#x27;m using PostgreSQL as the database and Azure Storage Blobs and Queues in.
.NET Aspire is awesome for this, as you can setup a developer inner loop super simply with the components that ship, and the nice thing about this is that locally PostgreSQL is run in a Docker container and Azure Storage uses the Azurite storage emulator (which also happens to run in a container).
The problem with this is that when you restart your app, you lose all the data in the database and storage emulator, since they are started fresh each time.
Turns out, it&#x27;s a pretty easy fix - all that you need to do is mount a volume into the cont…</a>

              Consolidating CSV results files in Azure Load Testing

However, you can also download or export the test results, build your own dashboards and reporting, for example, using Microsoft Excel or Power BI. You can also use JMeter backend listeners to write the results to a data store of your choice and analyze the data.
When you use the download results option, the ALT service splits the results into one CSV file per engine. This ensures that the file size is not huge, and it is easy to open the files in tools like notepad, excel to analyze the data. In cases where your input data is split across test engines, you can pick the results file for a specific engine and analyze.

              Send HTTP 2.0 Request to App Service using C#
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9868 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/send-http-2-0-request-to-app-service-using-c/ba-p/4034469>Azure App Service supports HTTP 2.0. The major advance of HTTP/1.1 was the use of persistent connections to service multiple requests in a row. In HTTP/2, a persistent connection can be used to service multiple simultaneous requests. 
 
This blog will demonstrate how you can send HTTP 2.0 Request to app service for testing using C#:
 
Step 1:
Go to &gt; App Service &gt; Configuration &gt; Enable HTTP 2.0

 
Step 2:
Create a .Net Core Console Application / Web Application as per requirement . In this example I have taken a .Net Core Console Application:
 
 
var client &#x3D; new HttpClient() { BaseAddress &#x3D; new Uri(&quot;https://.azurewebsites.net&quot;) };

            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Sending HTTP 2.0 Request.&quot;);

            // HTTP/2 request
            using (var request &#x3D; new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, &quot;/&quot;) { Version &#x3D; new Version(2, 0) })
            using (var response &#x3D; await client.SendAsync(request))
                Console.WriteLine(response);


 
 
The HTTPClient class has DefaultRequestVersion property with which you can set the default version of the requests as below:
 
 
var SecondRequest &#x3D; new HttpClient()
            {
                BaseAddress &#x3D; new Uri(&quot;https://.azurewebsites.net&quot;),
                DefaultRequestVersion &#x3D; new Version(2, 0)
            };

            // HTTP/2 is default
            using (var response &#x3D; await SecondRequest.GetAsync(&quot;/&quot;))
                Console.WriteLine(response);
 
 
You should be able to see a successful HTTP Response once the code executes:

MIT license
TypeScript codebase
Contributions welcome
If you want to learn about the open source codebase, I wrote quite a few blog posts about the architecture that are now archived in the docs repo. The README has been expanded, to some extent, with setup details.
I’d really love if folks tried out and made use of it. You can really do anything - use it as the foundation for your own application, pull parts into standalone modules, you name it.
→ Placemark repository
Details:
The public repository has a flat git history, to maximize security and keep my silly
private commit messages out of the public web. I made 1,439 commits, 406,048++ 218,320–
throughout the year. Adam Krebs contributed to
the feature table element as well (3 commits, 570++ 279–)
It’s complicated. I know it’s a fairly complicated codebase, and also that it is need
of an update to Next.js. It’s also built on Blitz, which,
while I love it, is getting lapped by tools like tRPC,
and could be replaced with them.
I’ll be moving more issues from the private repository to the public one
over time.
The Placemark website is staying online as-is
for a little while, until I can archive some pages that are hard to archive. Any advice
for how to archive a Webflow site would be much appreciated: their options
are really limited.
Have any other questions, or comments? Ask me. The discussions board
is probably a good place to do that, if you have something private you need to
ask, my email is on this site.
I’m doing great! Val Town is going really well, and
I’m excited for Placemark’s new era. Don’t worry about me.</a>

Container Apps is also tailored for microservices and built on cloud native tech which means .NET Aspire integrates to it seamlessly– right out of the box! 
 
Furthermore, the .NET Aspire stack offers a tailored deployment experience for ACA through the Azure Developer CLI (AZD), which lets you create, provision, and deploy the Azure resources for your Aspire solution with a single command.

When it comes to website security, one important step is to add a custom domain and connect it with a TLS/SSL certificate. This not only enhances the trust and safety of your website but also ensures that your visitors&#x27; information is encrypted and protected. Azure App Service provides TLS bindings for the most common custom domains. This blog discusses the special domain and certificate binding situations in Azure App Service for IDN hostnames.

What is an IDN hostname?
An IDN hostname is a domain name that includes characters used in the local representation of languages not written with the basic Latin alphabet &quot;a-z&quot;. These characters can be Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Cyrillic, Tamil, Hindi, and more.
The internet is primarily based on ASCII, which does not support these characte…</a>

Organisations are increasingly understanding the value that machine learning and artificial intelligence can deliver across all industries. Subsequently those organisations are also evaluating how to move machine learning projects from experimental stages to production. This surge in AI/ML interest also comes at a time when businesses are prioritising cost optimization of new and existing technology projects.
 
Frequently customers I am speaking too are asking how they can deploy reliable, robust and cost effective deployment platforms for moving machine learning models into production. Customers using Azure to deploy CPU based ML models have a few different options, batch endpoints on Azure Machine Learning, AKS for those familiar with running enterprise Kubernetes and Azur…</a>

All Azure Spring Apps regions under the Enterprise plan are eligible for substantial cost savings – 20% for one year and 47% for three years – when you commit to Azure savings Plan.
 
Committing to the savings plan allows you to get savings, up to the hourly commitment amount, on the resources you use. You can choose to pay all at once or monthly. The best part? Turning on the Savings Plan will not mess with your current set-ups or apps. You just get the savings while everything runs as usual. If you are running big apps, this plan can optimize your investments. It brings down your overall costs for using Azure Spring Apps Enterprise.

Say goodbye to the complexities of JMeter scripting with our new feature which allows you to create load tests directly by providing your HTTP requests. No prior expertise in testing tools is required – just navigate to the portal, input your HTTP requests, and you&#x27;re all set! 
With this new experience you can specify the endpoint, HTTP method, headers, query parameters, or just enter cURL commands effortlessly. But that&#x27;s not all you also have additional functionalities with this.

Extract data from the response of one request and pass it on to a subsequent request. For example, if you are retrieving an authentication token in a request and would like to use it for authentication in your subsequent requests, you can store it in a variable and do so.

We have partnered with Brave Search to bring their search results into Kagi. Brave joins the growing list of Kagi&#x27;s search sources, ensuring that if you can not find something on Kagi, it does not exist on the web. This will come at no additional cost to you, thanks to continuous optimizations in our search stack.



Kagi Assistant usage stats are now on the stats page. Assistant is still in beta and currently available to Ultimate plan users. We plan to roll it out to all members in January.  #2141 @Grooty
