This enhancement allows you to define precise failure conditions based on the performance of your server-side components, providing greater insight into performance bottlenecks and resource throttling issues.
Why Server-Side Metrics Matter
Traditionally, Azure Load Testing has empowered users to define test-failure criteria tailored to client-side metrics. By setting threshold values for these metrics, users could determine when their load test should be considered a failure. However, performance bottlenecks often originate from server-side resource constraints. By allowing test criteria configuration on server-side metrics, we provide a more comprehensive moni‚Ä¶</a>

              Transition from Alpine Linux to Debian for WordPress on App Service

While Alpine has served us well with its lightweight and performant nature, our evolving needs require a more feature-rich environment. Debian is the ideal candidate to support our next phase of development and growth. This transition will also align us with App Service Linux, which already utilizes Debian as the default Linux distribution.
For those who might not be familiar, Linux distributions, or Linux distros, are complete operating system packages that include the Linux kernel and a set of pre-installed programs. There are hundreds of distros available; some are commercial, while others are community-developed. Alpine Linux and Debian ar‚Ä¶</a>

Since our last post, we have released support for .NET 8 on the in-process model! Apps already using .NET 6 on the in-process model can move to .NET 8 by following the steps in the updating to target .NET 8 on the in-process model guidance.
¬†
Please keep in mind that support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026, and you‚Äôll want to begin planning your migration to the isolated worker model in advance of that date.

As we aim to improve the developer experience, and through our interactions with users, we recognize the need for simpler, more efficient troubleshooting. Today, we‚Äôre excited to introduce a new web-hosted reporting dashboard to help speed up the troubleshooting and make it easier for developers to identify and resolve issues. To further enhance security, we‚Äôre also implementing Microsoft Entra ID as the default authentication method, providing a more secure and seamless workflow.
Read on to learn more about what‚Äôs now possible with Microsoft Playwright Testing.
