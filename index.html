That has since been released, and in this post, we‚Äôll cover what you can expect throughout the rest of 2024.
¬†
.NET 8 option for the in-process model
Since our last post, we have released support for .NET 8 on the in-process model! Apps already using .NET 6 on the in-process model can move to .NET 8 by following the steps in the updating to target .NET 8 on the in-process model guidance.

Please keep in mind that support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026, and you‚Äôll want to begin planning your migration to the isolated worker model in advance of that date.

.NET 9 (Preview)
The isolated worker model now supports .NET 9 as a Preview on Linux, starting with .NET 9‚Ä¶</a>

This means your WordPress site can securely access other Azure resources, like Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server and Azure Communication Service Email, without the hassle of managing connection strings and secrets.

What is a managed Identity and why should you implement it for WordPress on App Service?
A frequent issue developers face is handling secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys needed for secure communication between services. Managed identities remove the necessity for developers to oversee these credentials.
Even though developers can securely store secrets in Azure Key Vault, services still require a method to access it. Managed identities offer an automatically managed id‚Ä¶</a>

In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to leverage Azure API Management to enhance the resiliency and capacity of your OpenAI Service.Azure API Management is a tool that assists in creating, publishing, managing, and securing APIs. It offers features like routing, caching, throttling, authentication, transformation, and more.By utilizing Azure API Management, you can:

Distribute requests across multiple instances of the Azure OpenAI Service using the priority-based load balancing technique, which includes groups with weight distribution inside the group. This helps spread the load across various resources and regions, thereby enhancing the availability and performance of your service.

Since its release in May 2023, Azure Developer CLI (azd) has evolved significantly. azd nowadays even automatically generates Bicep files for us to immediately provision and deploy applications to Azure. With this feature, you only need the azd up command for provisioning and deployment.

Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how to provision and deploy .NET apps including Azure Functions to ACA through just one command, azd up.

Kagi Store
Kagi Store is live! Grab your first edition Doggo t-shirt while the stock lasts.

Getting this out of the door was quite a journey. We wrote a small blog post about it.
 

We moved mountains (of cotton) to deliver on our promise
The Assistant video commercial
üé¨ Drumroll, please... Our first video commercial celebrating the launch of The Assistant is live, and we couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled and proud! Let us know what you think!
Check it out on YouTube!
Improvements and Bug Fixes (minor update post the Assistant launch)
You can now open the Kagi Search that the Assistant performed throughout all different thread responses.
Internet access is correctly set when the last used model is a Custom Assistant
When branching, earlier messages no longer disappear
Fixed an issue that disabled mouse scroll in the prompt box when large prompts were used
Fixed an issue where using Assistant bangs such as !code with another Custom Assistant present prevented the model selection from loading
While we finish implementing custom bangs for Custom Assistants, you can already create them manually by using the profile query parameter in the Assistant URL. For example: https://kagi.com/assistant?q&#x3D;%s&amp;profile&#x3D;id
id in the URL when editing your Custom Assistant</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2024/09/05/recently.html>Reading
Since last time, I read a few books: Sea of Tranquility, a book club book, Doppelganger, the new Naomi Klein, and Manywhere, a collection of short stories.
Sea of Tranquility was very digestible sci-fi. I haven‚Äôt read that much sci-fi overall, so it‚Äôs probably inaccurate to say that it‚Äôs spiritually similar to Ted Chiang, but that‚Äôs the closest reference I know of. In the end, I think it‚Äôs a little empty - the book shows off a lot of complexity but doesn‚Äôt really deliver on it and things conclude in a way that‚Äôs a bit too cute. That said, it was a perfect book to read in a few days and discuss with a friendly group.
Doppelganger, I found kind of annoying. I agree with Naomi Klein on nearly everything, including all of her thoughts in the book, and I think she‚Äôs a very cool person, ‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://kagifeedback.org/d/4716-sept-4th-2024-announcing-the-assistant/1>The Assistant is here!
Today we‚Äôre excited to unveil the Assistant, a new powerful tool for information consumption that complements Kagi Search. Assistant features direct access to world&#x27;s best LLMs, grounded in Kagi Search, all in one place and for one price.
Read all about it in Announcing the Assistant blog post.
This update replaces the Beta version introduced nearly a year ago. It includes many new features, and we are working hard to bring back a few missing ones from the Beta, notably file upload, as soon as possible. You can still access the &quot;old&quot; assistant during the transition period using this link.
We also want to take this opportunity to extend a big thank you to our community, especially to our distinguished members and contributors, for all the feedback and testing that helped us create a better product.

We recently expanded our social presence on the wider web to include Mastodon, Blue Sky and Threads, so be sure to engage with us and follow our journey from the platforms of your choice!

But what is it, and why is it better than API keys? Let&#x27;s try to answer that question and show a practical example of how to use managed identities in Azure.

What is managed identity?

It&#x27;s a feature in Azure that allows applications to authenticate to cloud services securely without needing to manage credentials like API keys. 

Managed identity in Azure works by providing an *automatically managed identity* for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authent‚Ä¶</a>

              How to disable SAS token on consumption/Premium plan hosted function apps

This means that even if we can use identity-based host connections to replace the AzureWebjobsStorage, which uses a SAS token, we still cannot remove the file share connection strings (WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING) that also rely on a SAS token. Therefore, we are unable to disable the SAS token in the storage account.
¬†
For now, when creating function apps in the consumption/EP plan, we have the option to create an app without Azure File. In this scenario, we can bypass the SAS token requirement for Azure Files and solely utilize managed identity to access the storage account.

To run your app without relying on Azure file share, you need to fulfill the following requirements:
