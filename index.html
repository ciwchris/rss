An array of over-the-counter remedies are available, but most of them don&#x27;t focus on the primary causes: oxidative stress and insufficient circulation. Now, researchers have designed a preliminary microneedle patch containing cerium nanoparticles to combat both problems, regrowing hair in a mouse model faster than a leading treatment.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/08/210805141141.htm>Two new molecules that generate minute amounts of the gas hydrogen sulfide have been found to prevent skin from aging after being exposed to ultraviolet light found in sunlight. Sunburn is a major cause of premature aging in skin, and a primary risk factor for skin cancer, and other skin problems associated with aging. Now, an international research team has made inroads towards being able to reverse or delay this damage for the first time.</a>

A new study demonstrates how changing parents&#x27; health behavior and how clinicians deliver care to mothers and infants decreased excess weight gain in infants.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210726234837.htm>Frontotemporal dementias are a group of fatal and debilitating brain disorders for which there are no cures. Researchers describe how they were able to recreate much of the damage seen in a widely studied form of the disease by growing special types of cerebral organoids in petri dishes. This form of the disease is caused by a genetic mutation in tau, a protein that is a hallmark of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other dementias. By studying these organoids, the scientists discovered how the mutated tau protein may trigger the death of a specific class of neurons known to be vulnerable in frontotemporal dementia. They also showed that they could prevent the death of these neurons by treating the organoids with an experimental drug, originally designed to combat Crohn&#x27;s disease.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210720114308.htm>Cellular competition is a crucial quality control process that ensures that the development of an organism relies on healthy cells. Researchers revealed the secrets underlying cell competition and what features can pre-determine whether a cell will survive or not. Defects in energy production are critical in making cells vulnerable to elimination.</a>

New research shows that the brain and spinal cord scars in people with MS may offer clues to why they developprogressive disability but those with related diseases where the immune system attacks the central nervous system do not. Researchers assessed if inflammation leads to permanent scarring in these three diseases.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210719103109.htm>Proteins are essential for body growth and muscle building. However, protein metabolism varies depending on the body&#x27;s internal biological clock. Therefore, it is important to know how distribution of protein intake over the day affects muscles. Researchers have now found that consumption of proteins at breakfast increases muscle size and function in mice and humans, shedding light on the concept of &#x27;Chrononutrition&#x27; that deals with the timing of diets to ensure organ health.</a>
