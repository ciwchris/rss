WebJobs are a feature of Azure App Service that allows you to run background tasks or scripts in your App Service. They are particularly useful for executing jobs such as scheduled tasks, data processing, or background maintenance tasks. WebJobs can run continuously, on-demand, or on a scheduled basis, and they can be written in various programming languages.
The goal of this blog post is to guide you through the process of setting up and deploying a WebJob on an Azure App Service running Linux. We will walk you through the necessary steps to create and deploy a WebJob, configure its settings, and manage it effectively. By the end of this blog, you will have a working WebJob integrated into your Azure App Service, capable of performing background tasks or processing jobs as ne‚Ä¶</a>

              Integrating Workload profile Container App with Front Door and Application Gateway Private Link
              <span class="post-metadata">(31 min | 9362 words)</span>

For the workload profile container app, private link support is not yet available. This is because the ‚ÄúPrivate Link Service does not support a load balancer that has an IP-based backend pool, which is used in Consumption + Dedicated environments (Workload Profile)‚Äù. Although we have a roadmap to implement this feature (Private link support for Workload Profiles ¬∑ Azure Container Apps Roadmap), there is currently no ETA.
¬†
In the meantime, I will guide you on how to integrate a workload profile container app with Azure Front Door using an Application Gateway. The architecture involves using the Application Gateway private link to connect to the Front Door, and placing the Application Gateway in the same VNET as the container app to achieve this integration.

35% of all exposed API keys are still active - 35% of exposed API keys still active, posing major security risks - Help Net Security


That&#x27;s a pretty scary statement, that means services are being misused most likely, data is actively being stolen and so on. 

Let&#x27;s try to understand why the concept of API keys is a problematic one and how we can move away from it.

This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won&#x27;t know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.
¬†
In this post, we&#x27;ll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We&#x27;ll create a simple API that implements the¬†Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job. This approach provides a much more robust and scalable solution for long-running tasks.

Steps:

Create an App registration in Microsoft Entra.


¬†
¬†
¬†

After creation, note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID, which will be used later.


¬†
¬†

Create a Linux web app in Azure Portal and use Node.js.


¬†
¬†

After creation, note down the App Name, which will be used later.


¬†
¬†
¬†

Download the sample code in your development environment:

¬†
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-docs-code-javascript.git
¬†
¬†
¬†

You can use VS Code to open the react-spa subfolder.

¬†
¬†
¬†

Edit src/authConfig.js and make the corresponding modifications:




clientId
Specify the Application (client) ID obtained in step 2


authority
Fill in the Directory (tenant) ID obtained in step 2 in the specified format. (https://login.microsoftonline.com/)


redirectUri
Fill in the App Name obtained in step 4 in the specified format. (https://.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback)




¬†
¬†
¬†

Run the following command to install the relevant packages:

¬†
npm install
¬†
¬†

Run the following command to compile the project. After execution, a build subfolder will be created.

¬†
npm run build
¬†
¬†

Create or modify build/.deployment with the following content:

¬†
[config]
SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT&#x3D;false
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†

Publish your project, specifying the build subfolder during the publishing process.




¬†
¬†

After publishing, go back to the App registration in Microsoft Entra, find Authentication, create a Platform, specify Single-Page Application, and fill in the value of authority from Step 7.


¬†
¬†
¬†

Go back to the project, navigate to Configuration, and specify the Startup Command as follows:

¬†
pm2 serve /home/site/wwwroot --no-daemon --spa
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†

After restarting the web app, you can visit your webpage using a browser.

Starting August 1st, Azure Container Registry (ACR) will update its behavior regarding the deletion and re-creation of registries. ACR will prevent the reuse of a subdomain name, e.g. abc123.azurecr.io, for a period after the resource is deleted. This updated behavior enhances security and prevents subdomain takeovers by automatically reserving registry names during the creation of the ACR resource, without requiring any additional action or configuration from customers.¬†

Once a resource name is reserved, it remains reserved from the moment of creation and throughout an extended period following the deletion of the resource (referred to as a cooldown period).

However, more and more enterprises are leaning towards using more secure network architectures. Due to the involvement of many different components, it is easy for minor configuration issues to cause the entire app to be unusable. Therefore, in this article, I will delve into more detailed content, specifically discussing NSG, UDR, DNS, and Storage Account.

Why we use it
This tutorial will introduce how to integrate Microsoft Entra with Azure SQL Server to avoid using fixed usernames and passwords. By utilizing user-assigned managed identities as a programmatic bridge, it becomes easier for Azure-related PaaS services (such as Function App or App Services) to communicate with the database without storing connection information in plain text.

Architecture

I will introduce each service or component and their configurations in subsequent chapters according to the order of A-D:

In preparation for the next steps for Kagi, we&#x27;re launching a new Discord server where we will consolidate both of our communities for Search, Orion, and all future Kagi products.
Join here: https://kagi.com/discord
We welcome everyone, whether you are a long standing supporter or just learning about Kagi, to come hang out with us and get excited about what&#x27;s coming next.
The existing servers will be sunset over the course of the following week.
See you there!

Well maybe you did, but I certainly didn‚Äôt. Whenever someone talks about any type of AI-based application, they&#x27;re almost always talking about Python. So, it was a welcome surprise for me to discover it since I&#x27;m way more familiar with Node than Python.

I decided to give the Node SDK a go just to see how well it works and stumbled upon a great cookbook tutorial by OpenAI. I took most of the code from that sample as-is, wrote a static front-end chat client for it, and then wired it up as a sample space called ‚ÄúActivity Planner Agent‚Äù that you can easily deploy in App Spaces.¬† The only prerequisite is that you‚Äôll need an OpenAI API key, which we‚Äôll walk through below.

What is it
Azure Web Apps or Azure Function Apps frequently communicate with Application Insights to log various levels of data, which can later be reviewed and filtered in the Log Analytics Workspace.
¬†
Taking Python as an example, the official documentation mentions that the OpenCensus package will no longer be supported after 2024-09-30.

¬†
¬†
The article suggests OpenTelemetry as the latest alternative. In response to the growing cybersecurity awareness among many companies, many users have disabled the &#x27;Local Authentication&#x27; feature in Application Insights to enhance security.

Therefore, this article will focus on how Web Apps/Function Apps can use Managed Identity to communicate with Application Insights and utilize the latest OpenTelem‚Ä¶</a>
