Say goodbye to the complexities of JMeter scripting with our new feature which allows you to create load tests directly by providing your HTTP requests. No prior expertise in testing tools is required ‚Äì just navigate to the portal, input your HTTP requests, and you&#x27;re all set! 
With this new experience you can specify the endpoint, HTTP method, headers, query parameters, or just enter cURL commands effortlessly. But that&#x27;s not all you also have additional functionalities with this.

Extract data from the response of one request and pass it on to a subsequent request. For example, if you are retrieving an authentication token in a request and would like to use it for authentication in your subsequent requests, you can store it in a variable and do so.

We have partnered with Brave Search to bring their search results into Kagi. Brave joins the growing list of Kagi&#x27;s search sources, ensuring that if you can not find something on Kagi, it does not exist on the web. This will come at no additional cost to you, thanks to continuous optimizations in our search stack.



Kagi Assistant usage stats are now on the stats page. Assistant is still in beta and currently available to Ultimate plan users. We plan to roll it out to all members in January.  #2141 @Grooty



We vastly improved Image search results. Check them here including all the powerful filters.
