The findings suggest that routinely alternating swims or dips in chilly water with sauna sessions might affect how brown fat, also known as brown adipose tissue (BAT), burns energy and produces heat.</a>

Their findings are based on human studies and laboratory experiments. The biomarker is based on measuring levels of so-called microRNAs. According to the study data, microRNAs could potentially also be targets for dementia therapy.</a>

It is often assumed that feeling more negative will color people&#x27;s experience of emotional images and events in the environment around them. However, researchers found that while going 24 hours without sleep impacted study participants&#x27; mood, it did not change their performance on tests evaluating their ability to process emotional words and images.</a>

Scientists revealed how gut bacteria contribute to the progression of advanced prostate cancers and their resistance to hormone therapy -- by providing an alternative source of growth-promoting androgens, or male hormones. The findings, once further validated in the clinic, could provide new opportunities for the treatment of prostate cancer through manipulation of the microbiome.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/10/211005124658.htm>A drug commonly used to treat cancer can restore memory and cognitive function in mice that display symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, new research has found. The drug, Axitinib, inhibits growth of new blood vessels in the brain -- a feature shared by both cancer tumors and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. This hallmark represents a new target for Alzheimer&#x27;s therapies. Mice that underwent the therapy not only exhibited a reduction in blood vessels and other Alzheimer&#x27;s markers in their brains, they also performed remarkably well in tests designed to measure learning and memory.</a>

Researchers discovered mice who ate high-fat diets produced less of these tags on their intestinal cells, suppressing the ability of immune cells to identify and eliminate intestinal tumors. The high-fat diet also reduced the presence of certain bacteria in the mice&#x27;s gut, which normally helps maintain the production of these tags.</a>

The group searched for integrated structures that encompass most of the brain but change configuration from time to time. Their hypothesis was these structures should vanish during states of deep unconsciousness, such as deep sleep or while under general anesthetics.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/09/210921125146.htm>Researchers have uncovered a molecular mechanism behind why obesity can lead to hair thinning. They found that stem cells within hair follicles in mice given a high-fat diet behaved differently from those in mice with a standard diet. Inflammatory signals in the stem cells led to these differences, ultimately resulting in hair thinning and loss. These fascinating data shed light on the complicated link between obesity and organ dysfunction.</a>

But according to a new article, when it comes to getting healthy and reducing mortality risk, increasing physical activity and improving fitness appear to be superior to weight loss. The authors say that employing a weight-neutral approach to the treatment of obesity-related health conditions also reduces the health risks associated with yo-yo dieting.</a>
