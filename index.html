Serverless compute allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. Serverless Stream processing is increasingly becoming a vital part of complex distributed systems. An event streaming platform like Kafka is capable of handling trillions of events, manipulates data as it arrives, supports publishing of data to any number of systems or real-time applications running in distributed systems.

With this release, Durable Functions now supports .NET, Node.js, Python, PowerShell, and finally Java running on Azure Functions. In this post, I&#x27;ll give a brief tour of Durable Functions for Java to highlight some of the capabilities and differences compared to other languages.

My team (the Cloud Native Advocacy team) and I have been kicking the tires on this service since the preview was announced.
¬†
After working through some getting started experiences in the preview with a couple of my teammates, both of them expressed the idea that a docker-compose file should provide enough information to create an Azure Container Apps environment and microservices deployment.¬† The Compose specification is open source and has been used to create a variety of tools to support other deployment options, so I thought it‚Äôd be worth a try.

By enabling dynamic concurrency, the platform can adjust the concurrency of functions dynamically in the condition that the worker instance is healthy(like CPU and thread utilization is healthy). You can refer to more information about dynamic concurrency in this link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-concurrency#dynamic-concurrency.
¬†
In this blog, I am writing to introduce how DC works in Azure function apps with some tests.
¬†
How to enable Dynamic Concurrency?
By default, dynamic concurrency is disabled. With dynamic concurrency enabled, concurrency starts at 1 for each function, and is adjusted up to an optimal value, which is determined by the host.

Therefore, you should follow an authentication and authorisation process to use the API unless it&#x27;s the public API. Those authentication/authorisation process uses either 1) an auth key or 2) an access token through an OAuth process.
¬†
Using the auth key approach, you can store it in a safe place like the Azure Key Vault service and fetch the key. It&#x27;s a relatively simple process. However, if you need to use the OAuth process, it gets complicated with the following authorisation process. Here&#x27;s the conceptual OAuth process.
¬†

Request an authorisation code
Receive the authorisation code
Request an access token by providing the authorisation code
Receive the access token and a refresh ‚Ä¶</a>

What is APIM Authorizations
Before we dive into creating the application, let&#x27;s quickly look at what this feature is.
¬†
In a connected system, being able to communicate between different Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms is a common task, but often these platforms will use OAuth2 to verify the user identity. This requires undertaking an authentication flow, which is fine if you&#x27;re directly using the system, but what if it&#x27;s being handled by a background job, like an Azure Function running with a Timer Trigger? Then we need to u‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
Getting started with Azure Load Testing has never been easier. You can now create a test without prior knowledge of testing tools by entering a URL on the Azure portal. You can set up, run, and test a URL in less than 5 minutes.
¬†
Run a quick test

Create an Azure Load Testing resource. You can use an existing resource if you have one.
Once it is created, navigate to the resource overview page.
In the Get started tab, click on Quick test.
Enter the URL you want to test.
Optionally, you can change any of the load parameters like number of virtual users, test duration, and ramp-up time.
Click on Run test.

Screenshot that shows the quick test interface in Azure portal
¬†
Congrats! You have created and run a load test for your web application.¬†You can modify the test parameters or extend the test by downloading and editing the JMeter script. Learn more about quick tests here. 
¬†
Once you are done exploring Azure Load Testing, you will want to delete your resource to avoid ongoing billing.
¬†
For more details on Azure Load Testing, check out the preview documentation. Learn more about pricing details on our Azure Load Testing pricing page.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/06/01/recently.html>Placemark made its first dollar this month. Victory!
More importantly, I got a lot of feedback about what would make it more
useful, and implemented a bunch of that, which I think has already improved
the product.
But, the list is long and every night I go to bed wishing that Placemark
just supported vertex-snapping already. I‚Äôll hopefully get to those
things before the requesters run out of patience with me. At this point,
my approach is just to advance the product. There‚Äôs some momentum, and there‚Äôs
some information about what‚Äôs important for users, and the best strategy
is to sprint toward that. I think.

Maybe a few other folks are thinking about the same problem area. Or have a different perspective that‚Äôll be useful to learn. Here goes.
I build Placemark, a map data editor. Placemark supports a lot of file formats - not all, but a good handful of the vector data formats for geospatial data.
I recently added support for FlatGeobuf, a really neat format that can store basically the same stuff as GeoJSON, but it produces much smaller files, includes a tree index so that you can search for geospatial data within a buffer, and supports random access by storing offsets to data in the file. I can take some tiny credit for a point in this evolution, having written the first specification of Geobuf, before it wa‚Ä¶</a>

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.</a>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they&#x27;d been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220504110405.htm>Substituting 20 % of meat from cattle with microbial protein -- a meat alternative produced in fermentation tanks -- by 2050 could halve deforestation, a new analysis finds. The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population&#x27;s increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220504082622.htm>In the search for eternal youth, fecal transplants may seem like an unlikely way to reverse the aging process. However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.</a>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220421100149.htm>Dentures may have a potentially negative impact on a person&#x27;s overall nutrition, according to new research. The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals&#x27; overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.</a>

The experiment was designed to test resistance to the phenomenon known as &#x27;incubation of craving,&#x27; meaning the longer a desired substance is denied, the harder it is to ignore signals for it. The findings suggest that exercise modulated how hard the rats were willing to work for cues associated with the pellets, reflecting how much they craved them.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220418164931.htm>Sodium is an essential micronutrient, but the amount we need is small. Three slices of bread or one teaspoon of table salt will do it, and chances are your daily sodium intake is far greater. More than 90% of Americans consume too much sodium, which can lead to hypertension, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. A new article provides a comprehensive review of scientific literature on sodium reduction strategies in food production.</a>
