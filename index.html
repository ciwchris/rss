By default, HTTP apps in Azure Container Apps are accessible via a public URL that is unique to the app. However, you can create a container app to use a reverse proxy like NGINX to control how traffic is routed to multiple apps based on the path or hostname.

In this tutorial, you&#x27;ll learn how to use Azure Container Apps to configure path and hostname-based routing for a set of containerized applications using NGINX as a reverse proxy. You&#x27;ll deploy 4 applications: 1 NGINX container which will be publicly exposed and 3 container apps which will only be accessible from within the environment and that traffic will‚Ä¶</a>

I‚Äôve been listening to this new-to-me CocoRosie
album. I fear that this is millenial music through

and their sound is almost an in-joke. But, like the rest of
their albums, this one has a few genuine bangers.

¬†
Backstage, originally created by a small team during a hack week, is now a CNCF Incubation project. An incubation project means that it is considered stable and successfully being used in production, at scale by enterprises. Backstage is a platform for building developer portals which act as an operational platform between developers and the services they need to deploy. Developer portals can accelerate developer velocity providing push button deployment of production ready services and infrastructure.

In this Walkthrough we will learn about what Backstage is as well as how we can build and deploy it on Azure using multiple services including:

Azure Container Registry

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker that allows you to connect, decouple, and exchange messages between different applications and services. It supports a range of communication patterns, such as queues, topics, and event hubs, and enables reliable and secure message delivery at scale.
However, to ensure that your Azure Service Bus solution can handle the expected load and performance requirements, you need to conduct load testing and measure the throughput, latency, and resource utilization of your system under various scenarios. Load testing can help you identify and resolve any bottlenecks, errors, or failures that might occur when your system is under stress.

In this blog, we will describe the best practices for mitigating risks when using public content from Docker Hub and other public registries.

Import public content locally whenever possible
Importing public content to an internal registry is the first step in a set of best practices for your software supply chain . Doing so raises the availability and reliability of your public content pipeline.

Here, we will be creating/updating a Container App Job using Azure Python SDK, while using Service Principal for authentication. Also, we will be using an App Service to deploy our project. We will be referring to the job creation sample which is one of the many templates provided in the Azure Python SDK template list.

¬†

How do you manage the lifecycle of those APIs?
What governance would you apply to these APIs?
What is the list of environments needed to manage these APIs?
What are the deployment strategies for those APIs?
How would you integrate those APIs with other services?

¬†
As your company&#x27;s number of APIs increases, so does the complexity of managing them. Azure API Center (APIC) is a central repository for your APIs lifecycle management, and it offers the more efficient ways for management. Throughout this post, I will take a first look at what Azure API Center is and what it offers.

You can find a sample code from this GitHub repository.

Kagi Bangs repository is now open source (thanks @Browsing6853 for suggesting this in #481). You can now refine the accuracy of existing bangs or introduce new ones for everyone to enjoy on Kagi Search. Your contributions will enhance the search experience for users worldwide.



Fresh from Kagi Labs: We&#x27;re shipping an alpha version of Kagi Sidekick, a search and &quot;chat with content&quot; solution for websites.
 

  
Kagi Sidekick will offer instant site search results, and on-demand AI generated summaries, by tapping directly into the website&#x27;s content. As a bonus, the website content will automatically (after opt-in) surface as a part of Kagi search index.
You can see Sidekick live in action in Kagi&#x27;s documentation.

Automatic Secret rotation solution:Based on the document (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/tutorial-rotation-dual?tabs&#x3D;azure-cli), it proposes a solution to generate new access keys on storage account and update it in the key vault based on the secret expiry time.

Discovering applications can be a challenge, especially in the case of bulk migrations of large environments potentially containing hundreds or more applications.¬†Azure Migrate¬†makes discovery of web apps, servers, and even databases simpler than ever. Just run the appropriate Azure Migrate tool in your VM or on-prem environment to generate an inventory of applications, servers, and databases.¬†

              RECORDING TEST SCENARIOS IN JMETER

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/recording-test-scenarios-in-jmeter/ba-p/4045051>Hey there, performance testers! Tired of handcrafting your JMeter scripts? Well, buckle up, because JMeter has a sweet trick up its sleeve called script recording. Skip the manual coding and let JMeter capture your app clicks like a digital detective. It translates these clicks into a script filled with all the JMeter elements you need.¬†Record your scenario in JMeter and upload it on Azure load Testing for analysing your application‚Äôs performance.
Ready to see how it works? Let&#x27;s dive in!
¬†
STEPS TO PERFORM JMETER RECORDING
For the purpose of our demonstration, we will be load testing our web application, an online shopping application called Contoso Traders. Let‚Äôs go.
¬†
CREATE A JMETER TEMPLATE

Open the JMeter GUI in your local PC. Navigate to Templates and select the ‚ÄòRecording‚Äô templat‚Ä¶</a>

              Observability on Azure Container Apps

Our systems can sometimes be a black box. We toss a request into it and get something back, but what goes on inside? Cutting through the tech jargon,¬†observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.
¬†
You might wonder, isn‚Äôt that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there‚Äôs a glitch slowing things down (that‚Äôs the¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äù). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the¬†‚ÄúWhy‚Äù).
¬†
Let‚Äôs say an app is responding slowly. We might have all these cool charts and graphs showing us the problem, but do they tell us why it‚Äôs happening? Not always.
¬†
That‚Äôs where solid observability comes in‚Ä¶</a>

While the complete implementation is still in progress, we want to provide you with a sneak peek into this upcoming feature. Moreover, we&#x27;ll guide you on how to start using it immediately (with certain restrictions) on Linux App Service. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll delve into the Sidecar pattern, its significance, and practical ways to leverage it for your applications.
What is the Sidecar Pattern
Applications and services often require related functionality, such as monitoring, logging, configuration, and networking services. These peripheral tasks can be implemented as separate components or services, built using different languages and technologies.
