              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/recording-test-scenarios-in-jmeter/ba-p/4045051>Hey there, performance testers! Tired of handcrafting your JMeter scripts? Well, buckle up, because JMeter has a sweet trick up its sleeve called script recording. Skip the manual coding and let JMeter capture your app clicks like a digital detective. It translates these clicks into a script filled with all the JMeter elements you need.¬†Record your scenario in JMeter and upload it on Azure load Testing for analysing your application‚Äôs performance.
Ready to see how it works? Let&#x27;s dive in!
¬†
STEPS TO PERFORM JMETER RECORDING
For the purpose of our demonstration, we will be load testing our web application, an online shopping application called Contoso Traders. Let‚Äôs go.
¬†
CREATE A JMETER TEMPLATE

Open the JMeter GUI in your local PC. Navigate to Templates and select the ‚ÄòRecording‚Äô templat‚Ä¶</a>

              Observability on Azure Container Apps

Our systems can sometimes be a black box. We toss a request into it and get something back, but what goes on inside? Cutting through the tech jargon,¬†observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.
¬†
You might wonder, isn‚Äôt that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there‚Äôs a glitch slowing things down (that‚Äôs the¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äù). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the¬†‚ÄúWhy‚Äù).
¬†
Let‚Äôs say an app is responding slowly. We might have all these cool charts and graphs showing us the problem, but do they tell us why it‚Äôs happening? Not always.
¬†
That‚Äôs where solid observability comes in‚Ä¶</a>

While the complete implementation is still in progress, we want to provide you with a sneak peek into this upcoming feature. Moreover, we&#x27;ll guide you on how to start using it immediately (with certain restrictions) on Linux App Service. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll delve into the Sidecar pattern, its significance, and practical ways to leverage it for your applications.
What is the Sidecar Pattern
Applications and services often require related functionality, such as monitoring, logging, configuration, and networking services. These peripheral tasks can be implemented as separate components or services, built using different languages and technologies.

Distributed Tracing V2 Improvements¬†

The first implementation of Distributed Tracing supported only the .NET in-process model and the Azure Storage backend. The V1 implementation is still in an experimental state. Distributed Tracing V2, on the other hand, is not an experimental feature and supports all Durable Functions lang‚Ä¶</a>

In this article, we will learn how to use the migration plugin to move your WordPress site to App Service.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2024/01/28/work-hard-and-take-everything-seriously.html>Every few months on Twitter, there‚Äôs some dustup about work-life
balance and whether it‚Äôs a good or bad idea to work hard when you‚Äôre
young. Like most of these recurring debates, it has generated two
opposite archetypes:
The anti-capitalist tells the young worker not to trust HR and not to
buy into the idea of work as family. Your employment contract is the
only thing that binds you to your job, and that can be terminated on
either side. Arrive at 9, leave at 5. Prioritize the family.
The hustlebro tells you to wake up at 7am and get to work, and
give it your all. Hustle, and earn as much as you can, build those
connections. You can get work-life balance when you‚Äôre older, your
early 20s are the time for making that cheddar and staying
up till 1am.

Recently, I&#x27;ve been building an app using .NET Aspire which I&#x27;m using PostgreSQL as the database and Azure Storage Blobs and Queues in.
.NET Aspire is awesome for this, as you can setup a developer inner loop super simply with the components that ship, and the nice thing about this is that locally PostgreSQL is run in a Docker container and Azure Storage uses the Azurite storage emulator (which also happens to run in a container).
The problem with this is that when you restart your app, you lose all the data in the database and storage emulator, since they are started fresh each time.
Turns out, it&#x27;s a pretty easy fix - all that you need to do is mount a volume into the cont‚Ä¶</a>

However, you can also download or export the test results, build your own dashboards and reporting, for example, using Microsoft Excel or Power BI. You can also use JMeter backend listeners to write the results to a data store of your choice and analyze the data.
When you use the download results option, the ALT service splits the results into one CSV file per engine. This ensures that the file size is not huge, and it is easy to open the files in tools like notepad, excel to analyze the data. In cases where your input data is split across test engines, you can pick the results file for a specific engine and analyze.

              Send HTTP 2.0 Request to App Service using C#
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9868 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/send-http-2-0-request-to-app-service-using-c/ba-p/4034469>Azure App Service supports HTTP 2.0.¬†The major advance of HTTP/1.1 was the use of persistent connections to service multiple requests in a row. In HTTP/2, a persistent connection can be used to service multiple simultaneous requests.¬†
¬†
This blog will demonstrate how you can send HTTP 2.0 Request to app service for testing using C#:
¬†
Step 1:
Go to &gt; App Service &gt; Configuration &gt; Enable HTTP 2.0

¬†
Step 2:
Create a .Net Core Console Application / Web Application as per requirement . In this example I have taken a .Net Core Console Application:
¬†
¬†
var client &#x3D; new HttpClient() { BaseAddress &#x3D; new Uri(&quot;https://.azurewebsites.net&quot;) };

            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Sending HTTP 2.0 Request.&quot;);

            // HTTP/2 request
            using (var request &#x3D; new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, &quot;/&quot;) { Version &#x3D; new Version(2, 0) })
            using (var response &#x3D; await client.SendAsync(request))
                Console.WriteLine(response);


¬†
¬†
The HTTPClient class has DefaultRequestVersion property with which you can set the default version of the requests as below:
¬†
¬†
var SecondRequest &#x3D; new HttpClient()
            {
                BaseAddress &#x3D; new Uri(&quot;https://.azurewebsites.net&quot;),
                DefaultRequestVersion &#x3D; new Version(2, 0)
            };

            // HTTP/2 is default
            using (var response &#x3D; await SecondRequest.GetAsync(&quot;/&quot;))
                Console.WriteLine(response);
¬†
¬†
You should be able to see a successful HTTP Response once the code executes:
¬†

¬†

MIT license
TypeScript codebase
Contributions welcome
If you want to learn about the open source codebase, I wrote quite a few blog posts about the architecture that are now archived in the docs repo. The README has been expanded, to some extent, with setup details.
I‚Äôd really love if folks tried out and made use of it. You can really do anything - use it as the foundation for your own application, pull parts into standalone modules, you name it.
‚Üí Placemark repository
Details:
The public repository has a flat git history, to maximize security and keep my silly
private commit messages out of the public web. I made 1,439 commits, 406,048++ 218,320‚Äì
throughout the year. Adam Krebs contributed to
the feature table element as well (3 commits, 570++ 279‚Äì)
It‚Äôs complicated. I know it‚Äôs a fairly complicated codebase, and also that it is need
of an update to Next.js. It‚Äôs also built on Blitz, which,
while I love it, is getting lapped by tools like tRPC,
and could be replaced with them.
I‚Äôll be moving more issues from the private repository to the public one
over time.
The Placemark website is staying online as-is
for a little while, until I can archive some pages that are hard to archive. Any advice
for how to archive a Webflow site would be much appreciated: their options
are really limited.
Have any other questions, or comments? Ask me. The discussions board
is probably a good place to do that, if you have something private you need to
ask, my email is on this site.
I‚Äôm doing great! Val Town is going really well, and
I‚Äôm excited for Placemark‚Äôs new era. Don‚Äôt worry about me.</a>
