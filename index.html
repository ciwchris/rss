Serving as a localized DNS service, it supersedes mappings provided by external DNS servers, enhancing efficiency in local domain resolution. Its location varies according to the operating system utilized. Failure to retrieve IP addresses from a locally installed server or resolve them through DNS can result in application startup issues, underscoring the critical role of the hosts file in network connectivity.
Steps to create hostfile entry on Windows Virtual Machine:1. Open your text editor in Administrator mode. To do this, right-click on your text editor application (such as Notep‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
And when things move fast, you need to be able to experiment and iterate quickly. First to validate your ideas with a prototype, then to scale up to production if it works.
¬†
In this article, we&#x27;ll show you how LangChain.js, Ollama with Mistral 7B model and Azure can be used together to build a serverless chatbot that can answer questions using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. We&#x27;ll see first how you can work fully locally to develop and test your chatbot, and then deploy it to the cloud with state-of-the-art OpenAI models.

              Increasing the default vm.max_map_count value
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 239 words)</span> 
            </summary>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/increasing-the-default-vmmax_map_count-value/>The vm.max_map_count paramater will be increased from the default 65530 value to 1048576.
This change should help address performance, crash or start-up issues for a number of memory intensive applications, particularly for (but not limited to) some Windows games played through Wine/Steam Proton. Overall, end users should have a smoother experience out of the box with no expressed concerns about potential downsides in the related proposal on arch-dev-public mailing list.
This vm.max_map_count increase is introduced in the 2024.04.07-1 release of the filesystem package and will be effective right after the upgrade.
Before upgrading, in case you are already setting your own value for that parameter in a sysctl.d configuration file, either remove it (to switch to the new default value) or make sure your configuration file will be read with a higher priority than the /usr/lib/sysctl.d/10-arch.conf file (to supersede the new default value).</a>

As many of you may have already read (one), the upstream release tarballs for xz in version 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 contain malicious code which adds a backdoor.
This vulnerability is tracked in the Arch Linux security tracker (two).
The xz packages prior to version 5.6.1-2 (specifically 5.6.0-1 and 5.6.1-1) contain this backdoor.
The following release artifacts contain the compromised xz:
installation medium 2024.03.01
virtual machine images 20240301.218094 and 20240315.221711
container images created between and including 2024-02-24 and 2024-03-28
The affected release artifacts have been removed from our mirrors.
We strongly advise against using affected release artifacts and instead downloading what is currently available as latest version!

They‚Äôve been somewhat successful! The Placemark plugin has 11.3k users,

The feedback loop for plugins is okay - you can see how many likes
your plugin has received, and how many ‚Äúusers‚Äù there are, but no
change-over-time statistics, so I built my own dashboard for the plugins using Observable.


But even with that, I don‚Äôt really know whether many people are

Integrating a React Single Page Application (SPA) with a Python backend on Azure App Service offers a powerful combination for building dynamic web applications. By leveraging React for the frontend and Python for the backend, developers can create modern, responsive web applications with a seamless user experience.

¬†
Azure App Service provides a convenient platform for hosting both frontend and backend components of your application in a single environment, simplifying deployment and management tasks. With this setup, the React frontend can communicate with the Python backend through HTTP requests, enabling data exchange and interaction between the two layers.

In that post, we outlined a plan to stagger the .NET 8 releases, with support first coming to the isolated worker model, and the in-process model option coming a bit later. This is still the plan, and in this post, we wanted to discuss a bit more about how things will work once the option is available.

How the in-process model option for .NET 8 will work
One key difference between this and previous .NET version changes for the in-process model is that it will be an update solely focused on enabling .NET 8 support. There will be no additional Functions-specific breaking changes from the latest host version for .NET 6 that your project would‚Ä¶</a>

Starting from March 26th, we will begin including localized sales tax for all new customers who subscribe on or after this date.
April 9th, all existing customers who qualify for sales tax/VAT will see localized sales tax/VAT added to their monthly invoice in USD, on top of their current subscription fee. This adjustment will appear on your next invoice on or after April 9th, with no immediate extra charge.
 

If you are paying with an alternative method via Paypal, OpenNode, or any other non-Stripe provider: You will be prompted to pick a sales tax region the next time you go to purchase credit.
Discord or at support@kagi.com. We will be building an F.A.Q. page to answer any questions about the migration process.
To clarify, it means an end-price increase for affected members (sales tax/VAT will be automatically added on top of Kagi price, if applicable in your country/state) and this is mandated by Kagi becoming large enough to have legal sales tax/VAT obligation. In addition, Kagi will have to retroactively pay for all sales tax/VAT that we did not collect in the last almost two years. We have chosen to absorb this on behalf of our customers.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice, or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases‚Ä¶</a>

This method enhances security by avoiding the need to store credentials in code or configuration files. If you are interested in connecting to an Azure SQL database from a Python Function App using managed identity, you can find a related post here.
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets, keys, and certificates. With managed identities for Azure resources, you can authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication without needing credentials in your code.
Let&#x27;s dive into the steps to achieve this with a Python App Service.
