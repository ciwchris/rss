There are many reasons for this symptom, such as connection errors with the storage account, runtime being down, indexing failure, and the synctriggers failure that we&#x27;ll discuss.
 
To confirm whether your issue is indeed due to synctriggers, you could press F12 in your browser to activate developer mode and search for the keyword &quot;batch&quot; under the &quot;Network&quot; tab. This endpoint is used by the Azure portal to call various internal services of the Function App (e.g., retrieving app settings, site information, getting host status, etc.), including synctriggers.
 
Under the &quot;Network&quot; tab&#x27;s &quot;Payload&quot; section, you can find these invocation…</a>

You can easily create, configure, and execute load tests using JMeter scripts or custom code, and monitor the results in real-time on the Azure portal. You can also integrate your load tests with your CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub actions.
Until now, you could only view the load test results on the Azure portal, which required internet access and RBAC permissions. Now, you can download the report as an HTML file and share it with your stakeholders or teammates offline. The HTML report contains the same charts and metrics as the online report, but in a portable and convenient format.

In the team’s ongoing commitment to improving Azure Container Apps’ performance, we’ve recently made significant improvements to make the scaling and load balancing behavior of Azure Container Apps more intuitive and better align with customer expectations to meet their performance needs.
 
Hopefully, some of the insights from our experience in working with Envoy and KEDA will be helpful to you.

After working with customers, a few common challenges have shown up when building these intelligent applications.

Developers often feel that they need to become AI engineers to integrate the capabilities into their application.

There are in particular two questions that often come up when starting a new AI project:

How can I quickly validate an AI app idea, without investing too much time and resources?
If I have a working prototype, how fast can I scale it to production?

You don&#x27;t want to be outpaced by competitors or newer technologies, and you want to be able to quickly iterate on your ideas or pivot to new ones. This is where LangChain.js comes in.

Consider a connected car platform that processes data from millions of cars. Or a national retailer running pop-up campaign that processes pre-orders. Or a healthcare provider calculating big data analytics. All of these can have variable load requirements — from zero to tens of thousands of requests per second (RPS). The serverless model has grown rapidly as developers increasingly run event-triggered code as a service, pushing platform limits, and Azure Functions customers now want to orchestrate complex serverless solutions and expect high throughput.
 
This feedback led us to revamp the Azure Functions platform architecture to help ensure that it meets our customers’ most demanding performance requirements. As this article des…</a>

Introducing the Kagi and OpenStreetMap Basemaps
We have updated our maps page to include two new basemap options: the Kagi Basemap and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Basemap. You can switch between these options via the top left corner of the maps search bar.


The search results remain consistent across both basemaps; however, we are planning to introduce additional features and customisation options soon!

Azure Chaos Studio is a managed service that uses chaos engineering to help you measure, understand, and improve your cloud application and service resilience. Chaos engineering is a methodology by which you inject real-world faults into your application to run controlled fault injection experiments.
Azure Chaos Studio has added a new fault action for Azure Event Hubs called Change Event Hub State.
This fault action lets users disable entities within a targeted Azure Event Hubs namespace either partially or fully to test messaging infrastructure for maintenance or failure scenarios for an application dependent on an Event Hub.
The fault can be used in the Azure portal by designing experiments, deploying templates, or using the RES…</a>

It allows you to validate the test configuration, understand the application behavior under load, and troubleshoot any issues that arise. Today, we are excited to introduce Debug mode in Azure Load Testing, which enables running low scale test runs with better debuggability and enhanced logging.
 
Why Debug Mode?
Debug mode is designed to help you validate your test configuration and application behavior by running a load test with a single engine for up to 10 minutes. It provides debug logs for the test script, and request and response data for every failed request during the test run. This mode is powerful for troubleshooting issues with your test plan configura…</a>
