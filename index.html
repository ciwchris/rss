More importantly, I got a lot of feedback about what would make it more
useful, and implemented a bunch of that, which I think has already improved
the product.
But, the list is long and every night I go to bed wishing that Placemark
just supported vertex-snapping already. I‚Äôll hopefully get to those
things before the requesters run out of patience with me. At this point,
my approach is just to advance the product. There‚Äôs some momentum, and there‚Äôs
some information about what‚Äôs important for users, and the best strategy
is to sprint toward that. I think.

Maybe a few other folks are thinking about the same problem area. Or have a different perspective that‚Äôll be useful to learn. Here goes.
I build Placemark, a map data editor. Placemark supports a lot of file formats - not all, but a good handful of the vector data formats for geospatial data.
I recently added support for FlatGeobuf, a really neat format that can store basically the same stuff as GeoJSON, but it produces much smaller files, includes a tree index so that you can search for geospatial data within a buffer, and supports random access by storing offsets to data in the file. I can take some tiny credit for a point in this evolution, having written the first specification of Geobuf, before it wa‚Ä¶</a>

And as the Cloud Native ecosystem grows and evolves, more modern approaches for this use case are emerging.
¬†
The thing about retaining logs is that the storage requirements can get big. REALLY big.
¬†
One of the most common log search and indexing tools is¬†ElasticSearch. ElasticSearch is exceptionally good at finding a needle in the haystack (e.g.¬†When did the string &quot;Error message #123&quot; occur in any copy of application X on March 17th). It does this by¬†indexing the contents of the log message¬†which can significantly increase your storage consumption.
¬†
The enthusiastic team at Grafana created¬†Loki¬†to address this problem. Instead of indexing the full log message, Loki only indexes the metadata (e.g. label, names‚Ä¶</a>

              Azure Spring Cloud is now Azure Spring Apps

            </summary>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-spring-cloud-is-now-azure-spring-apps/ba-p/3425255>Since 2019, we‚Äôve expanded the capabilities of Azure Spring Cloud, including the Enterprise tier we announced in preview at SpringOne in 2021. ¬†Azure Spring Cloud is a fully featured platform for all types of Spring applications, and to better reflect this we‚Äôre now calling the service Azure Spring Apps.¬†
¬†
We‚Äôve created new versions for Azure CLI, as well as new plugins for Maven, IntelliJ and VS Code. Existing versions will continue to operate in deprecation mode.¬†¬†
You‚Äôll see this change is already reflected in the Azure portal, Azure CLI, API, Azure marketplace, and VMware Tanzu product descriptions. ¬†The name has already been updated in Microsoft Docs, but you will continue to see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.¬†
Changes in the Azure billing meter description, Powershell, Github actions, Azure DevOps task and Nubesgen will take place in upcoming weeks.¬†¬†
As introducing the name change in Terraform unavoidably interrupts existing behavior, we‚Äôre still in the process of evaluating whether we‚Äôll change the name in Terraform.¬†¬†
¬†
Action recommended¬†

Upgrade to the new version of Azure CLI with
az extension add -n spring
You can optionally remove the old extension using¬†
az extension remove -n spring-cloud 

Upgrade plugins for Maven , IntelliJ and VS Code.</a>

Azure Arc provides a simplified Governance and Management capability by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes allows us to on-board and manage Kubernetes clusters running anywhere - clusters running on other public cloud providers (GCP or AWS) or clusters running on on-premise data-centers (VMware vSphere or Azure Stack HCI) to Azure Arc. Azure Arc-enabled data services allows us to run Azure data services like SQL Managed Instance or PostgreSQL Hyperscale (preview) anywhere using Kubernetes.

Most HTTP 500 internal server error issues are likely to be caused by the unhandled exceptions thrown out by the application code. Besides monitoring the resources usage(CPU, memory, TCP connections etc) for the app service plan using &quot;Metrics&quot; under &quot;Monitoring&quot; from the Azure App Service portal, customers can further troubleshoot and diagnose these kinds of issues with Application Insights.

What if you still want to use the WordPress site to write content but only want to refresh the UI outside the site? What if you can even use C# for it through Blazor WebAssembly? You are now able to use the existing WordPress site as the data source of truth and build a UI in a separate instance with your preferred method. Does that sound attractive?

              Undone replacement of pipewire-media-session with wireplumber
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 223 words)</span> 
            </summary>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/undone-replacement-of-pipewire-media-session-with-wireplumber/>Two days ago the wireplumber package was made to replace pipewire-media-session as the latter session manager for PipeWire is considered dead upstream and will see no more releases. Unfortunately, this step was premature.
Our pipewire audio packages (pipewire-alsa, pipewire-jack and pipewire-pulse) ship configuration that prompt media-session to activate PipeWire&#x27;s audio features. When these packages are not installed and the configuration is missing, PipeWire can be used for screen recording without interfering with ALSA or PulseAudio.
WirePlumber disregards this mechanism and always configures PipeWire to grab audio devices, meaning users of PulseAudio or bare ALSA experience broken audio.
The replacement has been reverted while we attempt to look for a better solution switching to WirePlumber. If you are currently not using PipeWire for audio and wireplumber got installed on your system, please reinstall pipewire-media-session and reboot to restore audio functionality.
pacman -Syu pipewire-media-session</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220509171056.htm>Researchers describe a novel form of gene regulation that is altered in bladder cancer, leading to the boosting of a gene pathway that helps the cancer cells survive during rapid growth. The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.</a>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they&#x27;d been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.</a>

Now scientists have shown that the same may be true for cells, uncovering a newly-discovered mechanism that might help prevent the build-up of tangles of proteins commonly seen in dementia. Scientists have identified a new mechanism that appears to reverse the build-up of aggregates, not by eliminating them completely, but rather by &#x27;refolding&#x27; them.</a>

In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.</a>

We&#x27;ve seen a kind of performance/slow response/timeout issue of such web app, which is caused by the¬†MaxConcurrentSessions limit of WCF is hit. 
¬†
The symptom might include that after restarting the web app for a few hours, a percentage of the total requests (e.g. 1/3) get no response from the web server and timeout after 230 seconds. 230 seconds is the Azure default timeout value. The web app&#x27;s memory usage may be observed to grow continuously since the issue starts.¬†
¬†
The default MAX concurrent session setting of WCF server is 5000. If the WCF clients don‚Äôt close channels¬† properly, a lot of sessions which have been completed will not be able to get closed at the WCF s‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220428125438.htm>As race season approaches, many runners have the same goal: go faster. But researchers now show that speeding up might require defying our natural biology. By combining data from runners monitored in a lab along with 37,000 runs recorded on wearable fitness trackers, scientists have found that humans&#x27; natural tendency is to run at a speed that conserves caloric loss -- something that racers seeking to shave time off their miles will have to overcome.</a>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

Now, researchers have found that while these efforts have been effective, the incidence of higher-grade disease and metastasis at diagnosis have risen.</a>

The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals&#x27; overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.</a>

Three slices of bread or one teaspoon of table salt will do it, and chances are your daily sodium intake is far greater. More than 90% of Americans consume too much sodium, which can lead to hypertension, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. A new article provides a comprehensive review of scientific literature on sodium reduction strategies in food production.</a>
