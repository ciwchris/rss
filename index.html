              Refactoring Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions is also suitable for building CI/CD pipelines. But, compared to Azure DevOps, there are many spaces to achieve the same efficiency level as Azure DevOps. GitHub Actions has recently released a new feature called &quot;Reusable Workflows&quot;, which you can reduce the refactoring concerns. Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to refactor the existing Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD pipeline workflows, using the &quot;reusable workflows&quot; feature of GitHub Actions.
¬†
Workflow for Azure Static Web Apps
¬†
While provisioning an Azure Static Web Apps (ASWA) instance, GitHub Actions workflow is automatically generated by default. Here&#x27;s a sample workflow. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not that different from yours.

Platforms targeted for Spring Boot app deployments
Challenges with Spring Boot app migration to the cloud
Top monitoring tools and Spring Cloud components used today.

I‚Äôm spending a week in Germany. So far, I‚Äôve visited the one and only Zeppelin Museum and a castle. Technically I‚Äôve been trying to make this an unplugged vacation, so this will be short.
The traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because the market is ‚Äúefficient‚Äù (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.
Coase noted, however, that there are a number of transaction costs to using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is actually more than just the price of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentia‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
Kubernetes has become a platform of choice for building cloud native applications. Kubernetes is highly scalable, highly available, and easy to use, and has many other advantages that make it an excellent choice for building distributed applications.
¬†
However, its distributed nature means monitoring everything that is happening within the cluster can be a challenge. Prometheus and Grafana make our experience better.
¬†
In this article, we will set up a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and deploy Prometheus and Grafana to gather monitoring data and visualize them.
¬†
Understand the tooling

Prometheus is an open source project that was originally created at SoundCloud in 2012, and contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
The issue came up after the web app has been running for a while (several days), the response time of the site slowly increased. And in the end, the requests failed with timeout.
After we reviewed the memory dump and found out that the issue caused by the sites has many unique URLs requests, please refer to the section below.
¬†
Cause:
¬†

The Asp.net application can have a web.config files in each folder, it can help to set the specific configuration for that directory. You can find more details¬†here.¬†
IIS caches the web.config into the machine memory, this can automatically optimize our code by avoiding unnecessary file IO and XML parsing.
To process a request, IIS parses the request URL into directory and looks for the file client requested. Such as the request https://gsm.azur‚Ä¶</a>

Scale up: Get more CPU, memory, disk space, and extra features. You scale up by changing the pricing tier of the App Service plan that your app belongs to.
Scale out: Increase the number of VM instances that run your app. You can scale out to as many as 30 instances, depending on your pricing tier.¬†App Service Environments¬†in¬†Isolated¬†tier further increases your scale-out count to 100 instances. You can scale manually or automatically based on predefined rules and schedules.

These existing scaling workflows work well, but you may want to instead have the App Service platform automatically scale your web app without the hassle of defining auto-scaling rules &amp; schedules.

¬†
Today, we‚Äôd like to announce¬†the¬†Docker Compose Language Service in the Docker Extension for VS Code.¬†That‚Äôs right, the Docker Extension will now provide Docker Compose files with IntelliSense,¬†Tooltips, and syntax validation. Here are a few of the incoming features in¬†our 1.18 release:¬†
¬†

IntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)


¬†

Tooltips for Compose keywords (i.e.¬†services, image)¬†



Right-click¬†to¬†format¬†a Compose file¬†(Shift + Alt + F)¬†
YAML Syntax Validation¬†
Hyperlinks for Docker Images¬†

In our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!
¬†
There are more improvements to come!¬†Stay¬†tuned¬†for these features:

More tab completions
Docker Compose schema validation¬†
‚Ä¶ and much more!¬†

We love your feedback! If you have any comments¬†or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the¬†Compose Language Service Repo¬†or the¬†VS Code Docker Repo¬†for general feedback.</a>

And what kind of laughter do we find most positive? A new study shows that our laughter gives us away. The study included Dutch and Japanese producers of laughter and listeners. Listeners could detect whether a laughing person is from their own or another cultural group by only hearing a brief laughter segment. Spontaneous laughter was rated as most positive by both groups.</a>

That&#x27;s the conclusion of a team of researchers, whose study suggests that the new technology can preclude the use of carrageenan in chocolate milk. The widely used food additive -- which helps keep the liquid smooth and well-mixed even after days sitting on a store shelf -- is not desired by many consumers, especially in organic chocolate milk.</a>

The study, completed in an animal model and published in October in the Journal of Dental Research, found that excessive inflammation resulting from obesity raises the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), a group of immune cells that increase during illness to regulate immune function. MDSCs, which originate in the bone marrow, develop into a range of different cell types, including osteoclasts (a cell that breaks down bone tissue).</a>
