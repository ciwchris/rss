Astrocytes, which take their name from their star shape, ensure the survival of neurons by feeding and detoxifying them with the help of a multifunctional protein, APOE. One of three forms of this protein, APOE4, significantly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, but the mechanisms at play are unknown.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220228161621.htm>Researchers from two independent research teams have discovered how the mislocalization of a protein, known as TDP-43, alters the genetic instructions for UNC13A, providing a possible therapeutic target that could also have implications in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other forms of dementia. ALS and FTD are two neurodegenerative disorders in which many cases are linked by mislocalization of TDP-43, where instead of being primarily located in the nucleus of the cell where genes are activated, it forms aggregates outside the nucleus in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Rare mutations in the TDP-43 gene are known to cause ALS, but almost all cases of ALS show mislocalization of TDP-43.</a>

One of them is that you are asked to generate the OpenAPI document from the function app right after the build and integrate it with Power Platform or Azure API Management. What if you want to do this process within your CI/CD pipeline?

Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how to generate the OpenAPI document within the GitHub Actions workflow right after the function app build.

NOTE: Let&#x27;s use the sample app provided by the Azure Functions OpenAPI Extension repository.

First of all, you need to install the Azure Functions Core Tools within your GitHub Actions workflow. Installing the tool varies depending on the runner OS. The command‚Ä¶</a>

It was thoroughly refreshing. I‚Äôve been spending far too much time building a startup, reading about startups, being in the loop. My friends will tell me about an eight million dollar funding round and I‚Äôll say ‚Äúoh, that little, for a 2022 Series A?‚Äù I need perspective, a break, a breath of fresh air.
The thing about IndieWeb is that it‚Äôs still a place where people and ideas matter. You can have a whole conversation without mentioning money or a business plan. IndieWeb is about owning your own small parcel of internet-land and farming it with your own hands. Much like sharecropping, it isn‚Äôt ethically pure. But it‚Äôs a heck of a lot nicer than than the world built on value extraction and exclusion.

Developers can enable and use WebSockets in their applications by turning on WebSockets feature in App Service Configuration -&gt; General Settings portal.
¬†
This blog walks you through the process of creating a Java WebSocket sample application in both Windows and Linux App Service.
¬†
We will use a simple Java Spring Boot Websocket sample to build a server that accepts a message that carries a user‚Äôs name. In response, the server will push a greeting into a queue to which the client is subscribed.

Prerequisite

Azure account with an active subscription
JDK 1.8 or later
Maven 3.2+
Git client

¬†
Build &amp; Test the Java Spring Boot Websocket Service

For many years, scientists have assumed that the loss of connections between brain cells caused Alzheimer&#x27;s-related symptoms, including memory loss, but actual evidence of the role of synaptic loss had been limited to a small number of brain biopsies and post-mortem brain exams conducted on patients with moderate or advanced disease. However, the emergence of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning technology has allowed researchers to observe the loss of synapses in living patients with even mild symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</a>

When we launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019, we set out to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with many customers to help them adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, Kroger, Liantis,¬†Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley‚Äôs, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.

ADP-ribosyltransferases are enzymes that play a role in the modification of other proteins. The activity of this new mitochondrial enzyme, called NEURL4, is similar to that of PARP1, a nuclear enzyme well studied for its critical role in DNA damage repair and regulation of gene expression.</a>

Even though the pathophysiology of AD has been widely investigated, the likely relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and the disease remains largely unknown. A research team has now confirmed that AD progression is linked to oxidative brain damage, which impairs cognitive function in AD transgenic mice in an age-dependent manner.</a>

So for this post we&#x27;re going to address that as we take a look at logging using the Azure Application Insights platform (often referred to as AppInsights).
If you&#x27;re deploying into Azure in the ways that we&#x27;ve looked at in this series, chances are you&#x27;re already using AppInsights, as it&#x27;s the cornerstone of Azure&#x27;s monitoring platform, so let&#x27;s look at how to get better insights out of our GraphQL server.

In this post we&#x27;ll look at how we can add authentication to our GraphQL server.
For the post, we&#x27;ll use the Apollo Server and Azure Static Web Apps for hosting the API, mainly because SWA provides security (and if you&#x27;re wondering, this is how I came across the need to write this recent post).
If you&#x27;re new to GraphQL on Azure, I&#x27;d encourage you to check out part 3 in which I go over how we can create a GraphQL server using Apollo and deploy that to an Azure Function, which is the process we&#x27;ll be using for this post.

Last year my colleague Justin Yoo released an extension for .NET Azure Functions to generate OpenAPI definitions and not long afterwards he reached out to me on whether it&#x27;d be possible to do something similar for JavaScript/TypeScript Functions.
Well, good news, I&#x27;ve created a npm package to do that, which you can find on GitHub and in this post we&#x27;ll take a look at how to use it.
How it works
This npm package works conceptually similar to the .NET one in that you annotate the Function handler to provide OpenAPI schema information. This is done using a wrapper, or higher order, function, which takes a JavaScript object in that represents the schema for OpenAPI.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220207155437.htm>When Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico in September 2017 as a high-end category 4 storm, it left in its wake the largest catastrophe in the history of the island. Along with the human toll, the devastation impacted all the island&#x27;s wildlife, including a group of free-ranging rhesus macaques living on the isolated Cayo Santiago island near Puerto Rico. Now, a team of scientists has published one of the first results that shows the effects of natural disasters may have molecularly accelerated aging in the monkeys&#x27; immune systems.</a>

The detailed steps are provided in the following document:

While Storage Firewall is supported through service endpoint and private endpoint,¬† some configuration details are not addressed within the document. Today, this article will provide detailed steps on mounting the storage account using service endpoint and private endpoint.¬†

One thing to notice is that mounting the storage from the app service requires some ports to be open.¬†

For file share: Port 80 and 445 should be open

Getting Tailwind and Radix to play nice together
I‚Äôve been using Tailwind for Placemark‚Äôs
CSS foundation, and Radix for many of its
UI components. This mostly works great, because Radix makes it easy
to style your own components.
However, there‚Äôs a catch: a lot of important UI states for Radix
are distinguished by aria accessibility properties or HTML data-
attributes. For example, when the trigger for a dropdown menu
is engaged, Radix adds data-state&#x3D;&quot;open&quot; to the element.
This is all fine and dandy if you‚Äôre writing new CSS classes, or using

At Ignite, we announced¬†Azure Container Apps, a serverless application-centric hosting service that enables users to quickly deploy containerized applications and microservices to Azure without the need to configure and manage underlying infrastructure resources or container orchestrators. Azure Container Apps runs on ¬†Azure Kubernetes Service, and includes several open-source projects:¬†Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA),¬†Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), and¬†Envoy. This open-source foundation enables teams to build and run portable applications powered by Kubernetes and open standards without the operational overhead and management complexity of working with the platform directly.

Azure PowerShell is a set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line. Azure PowerShell is designed to make it easy to learn and get started with, but provides powerful features for automation.

Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications.

What is the discussion scope of this article?¬†

This article only discuss the Windows Azure App Service, Linux App Service is out of scope of this article.¬†

¬†
What happened?¬†

The Windows Azure App Service platform removed some minor NodeJS version. That could result in some un-expected result if the App Service&#x27;s configuration is not right.¬†

Is that removement is expected behavior?¬†

Yes.
Azure App Service is a PaaS service, and the platform will manage the Windows Node version.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/02/01/recently.html>I read The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn
in January, and it radically reshaped my conception of local
politics and the general arc of city politics in the last 50 years.
Highly, highly recommended stuff.

Brian Lovin did a design crit of Placemark,
which has been powering a big burst of activity on that front.
The energy on Placemark is happening in two semi-parallel efforts:
knocking out the last few core concepts - layers and properties, mostly -
and running through this new, super-helpful list of ideas and
critiques from Brian. The last few days have been super, super
productive as a result, to the extent that I‚Äôll probably crash
and take a few days off in a little bit. But for now, I‚Äôve
got energy and direction, and I‚Äôve got to ride it.

Reading
This paper on Ethnographic Research on Dynamicland
resonated with me. You can read a lot about the technology
and business of these sorts of efforts, but rarely is there
someone looking for the human interactions, and Dynamicland
is one of the most unusual and ambitious projects out there.
Bachmann doesn‚Äôt editorialize much, but I think some
themes emerge, like the tension between ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù/collaboration versus
authority and vision.
It reminded me of The Idea Factory,
that great book about Bell Labs. Research labs are this odd thing -
part of what made Bell Labs great was the ability to work on a slightly
longer timeline, with fewer limitations on what you created. But
that ability was directly a result of the government‚Äôs explicit
permittance of AT&amp;T Bell as a monopoly, during that period of time.
Listening
Townes Van Zandt by Townes Van Zandt

Been on a Townes Van Zandt kick recently, sparked of course
by seeing If I Needed You
pop up in an episode of Patriot.


Almost every time I‚Äôm very productive, it coincides with a full listen-through
of the whole Joanna Newsom ouvre. There‚Äôs nothing like it.</a>
