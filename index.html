These urges --known as cravings-- are very common, especially during pregnancy. During this time, the mother&#x27;s body undergoes a series of physiological and behavioral changes to create a favorable environment for the embryo&#x27;s development. However, the frequent consumption of tasty and high calorie foods -- derived from the cravings -- contributes to weight gain and obesity in pregnancy, which can have negative effects on the baby&#x27;s health.</a>

The idea has been rephrased a million times in different medias, but I like DFW‚Äôs framing of ‚Äúwhatever you worship will eat you alive‚Äù. A decade ago, I honestly believed I‚Äôd learn a few things, achieve what I wanted, and settle into a sort of non-striving creative flow for the rest of my days.

We become more susceptible to infections and vaccinations no longer work as effectively. A research team has investigated whether short-lived killifish also undergo aging of the immune system. Indeed, they found that as early as four months of age, killifish have less diverse circulating antibodies compared to younger fish, which may contribute to a generalized decrease in the immune function.</a>

The researchers show that, in UK data, girls experience a negative link between social media use and life satisfaction when they are 11-13 years old and boys when they are 14-15 years old. Increased social media use again predicts lower life satisfaction at age 19 years. At other times the link was not statistically significant.</a>

Genetic evidence in this same population suggested that all levels of alcohol intake are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Notably, the risk of cardiovascular disease linked to light alcohol consumption was modest but rose exponentially with higher intake, even at intake levels currently endorsed as &#x27;low risk.&#x27;</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/keycloak-1701-2-update-requires-manual-reconfiguration/>The keycloak package prior to version 17.0.1-2 was running with WildFly server. Since upstream officially moved to Quarkus distribution, Arch Linux follows this approach. This means some manual intervention is required for the upgrade.
The configuration needs to be adjusted from the old .xml format to the new /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf.
Prior to the upgrade, stop the keycloak service, upgrade the package and migrate the configuration before starting:
systemctl stop keycloak.service
pacman -Syu keycloak
# migrate configuration /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf
systemctl start keycloak.service

According to new research, lower HDL (high-density cholesterol) and high triglyceride levels measured in blood as early as age 35 are associated with a higher incidence of AD several decades later in life. Researchers also found that high blood glucose measured between ages 51-60 is associated with risk of AD in the future.</a>

In laboratory experiments, the ketogenic diet decreased glucose (sugar) levels in the tumor, suggesting the diet helped starve the cancer. In addition, this diet elevated ketone bodies produced by the liver, which put additional stress on the cancer cells.</a>

The study highlights the need to analyze molecular markers, such as genetic sequences or brain proteins, to obtain more accurate assays, diagnoses and therapies. The results also show changes in astrocytes in an attempt to adapt to the toxic environment derived from the disease, worsening its progression.</a>

The SCM site is the engine behind App Service for deployment, meaning that the release pipeline of Azure DevOps deploys code to the SCM site of an app. In most scenario, SCM site can be reached through public internet. Therefore, ensuring secure access to the site becomes more important. We can enable access restriction on SCM site or set up other firewall solutions to control incoming traffic to the site.

Here we will introduce you on how to identify and whitelist deployment traffic from Azure pipeline to SCM site with access restriction. This article also applies when setting up the same rules in other firewall solutions.

A team draws this conclusion based on a study of more than 200 volunteers. In light of their study data, the scientists consider modulating the activity of microglia to be a promising therapeutic approach. To this end, they aim to develop drugs that target a cellular receptor called TREM2.</a>

The researchers call on governments to use taxation, subsidies, education and other measures to encourage healthier eating habits, saying it is &#x27;an area of urgent need for action&#x27; in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.</a>

The study&#x27;s findings suggest that abnormal development in the brain&#x27;s centers for reward and inhibition may play a role. In the children with binge eating disorder, researchers saw elevations in gray matter density in areas that are typically &#x27;pruned&#x27; during healthy brain development. Disturbed synaptic pruning is linked to a number of psychiatric disorders.</a>

Today, we are announcing the Public Preview of support for clustered deployments of JBoss EAP on App Service. This means customers can run Java EE, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications which use stateful session beans, distributed transactions, and similar features that require instance-to-instance communication or high availability. Previously, individual JBoss EAP instances on App Service could not communicate with one another; with this update all nodes can communicate over a virtual network. Read on to learn more!

¬†

&quot;What if we can provision Azure Static Web App and deploy the app at the same time? If we can, we just simply hand over our PoC repository to developers so that they just run it directly from there.&quot;

¬†
Although two challenges exist to achieve this idea, if we can combine both challenges, devs can autopilot everything from the resource creating to the app deployment, which will result in improving the development experiences. Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to discuss how to offer the autopilot feature for your application repository.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/03/11/tidbyt-review.html>This is about the Tidbyt, a hardware display device I bought
and am using to show some numbers and charts in my apartment
as ambient data. I think it‚Äôs pretty cool.

Alternative display hardware
I really like alternative display technology.
eInk displays,
unlit LEDs, like on my AlphaSmart,
or flip-disc displays,
vane displays,
split-flap displays - I wish
it was all more widespread. Sure, those flip board displays have
mechanical failures more often than traditional screens, but
they look and sound so nice.
Most alternative display technology is expensive and inconvenient,
especially when compared to the absolute marvel of supply-chain
efficiency that is modern traditional LED displays. You can buy
a decent 39‚Äù TV for a little over $200 today. A 31‚Äù eInk panel will run you
$1,500, and a fl‚Ä¶</a>

They also devised a unique way of representing this data in two dimensions, making it easy to understand the past and future evolution of non-coding sequences in organisms beyond yeast -- and even design custom gene expression patterns for gene therapies and industrial applications. Despite the sheer number of genes that each human cell contains, these so-called &#x27;coding&#x27; DNA sequences comprise just 1% of our entire genome. The remaining 99% is made up of &#x27;non-coding&#x27; DNA -- which, unlike coding DNA, does not carry the instructions to build proteins.</a>

While cognitive function is often measured using paper and pencil tests with scores calculated by the number of correct answers, this number (score) omits a lot of information about the process a person uses to answer a question that might reveal important information about their brain function.</a>

They found that, by setting a risk threshold above which men are counted as &#x27;screen positive&#x27;, the approach would reduce the number of false positives by three quarters compared to a standard PSA test, while catching the same proportion of cancers.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220307113136.htm>Researchers have shown that a protein called MondoA can activate the important health-linked process of autophagy, whereby cells are broken down and their components are recycled. MondoA both inhibited a protein called Rubicon and regulated the Prdx3 protein, which maintains the stability of energy-producing mitochondria within cells. Activation of MondoA protected against aging and age-associated kidney injury, indicating its potential as a target for the treatment of aging and age-related diseases.</a>
