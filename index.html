              Masked email is a killer feature for Fastmail

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/09/24/masked-email.html>I last sang the praises of Fastmail in 2018, writing about how it’s pretty easy to avoid Google now that Google’s products are relatively middling. I’ve been using Fastmail exclusively since then and have only good things to say about it. The user interface is rock-solid and fast, and there have been very few times that they’ve had a server outage. But it’s just been qualitatively better than Gmail, not differentiated by a feature.
Masked email
That’s changed: I think that Fastmail’s “Masked Email” is a good reason for the Gmail-faithful to switch. It’s both a fantastic way to manage spam sources and a real win for privacy.
Masked email works best when you also use 1Password. You can then link your 1Password and Fastmail accounts, and whenever you see a signup form on the web, not only wil…</a>

              Changes to default password hashing algorithm and umask settings
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 319 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/changes-to-default-password-hashing-algorithm-and-umask-settings/>With shadow &gt;&#x3D; 4.14.0, Arch Linux&#x27;s default password hashing algorithm changed from SHA512 to yescrypt [1].
Furthermore, the umask [2] settings are now configured in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile.
This should not require any manual intervention.
Reasons for Yescrypt
The password-based key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing scheme yescrypt has been chosen due to its adoption (readily available in libxcrypt, which is used by pam [3]) and its stronger resilience towards password cracking attempts over SHA512.
Although the winner of the Password Hashing Competition [4] has been argon2, this even more resilient algorithm is not yet available in libxcrypt [5][6].
Configuring yescrypt
The YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR setting in /etc/login.defs is currently without effect, until pam implements reading its value [7]. If a YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR higher (or lower) than the default (5) is needed, it can be set using the rounds option of the pam_unix [8] module (i.e. in /etc/pam.d/system-auth).
General list of changes
yescrypt is used as default password hashing algorithm, instead of SHA512
pam honors the chosen ENCRYPT_METHOD in /etc/login.defs and does not override the chosen method anymore
changes in the filesystem (&gt;&#x3D; 2023.09.18) and pambase (&gt;&#x3D; 20230918) packages ensure, that umask is set centrally in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile

If so, you might be interested in using Managed Identities (MSI) or Service Principals to authenticate and authorize your app service to another app service that is protected by Azure Active Directory (AAD) using built-in authentication (Easy-Auth). 
 
In this article, I will show you how to use MSI or Service Principal of app1 to access app2, which is a custom resource that requires AAD authentication.
 
Normally, we would use the MSI-validator tool to test the functionality of MSI. However, it only supports specific resources and requires a pre-defined resource value. Currently, it can only use the following resources: default, keyvault, storage, and …</a>

We want to deploy Azure Policies with our Managed application to ensure the solution stays compliant and security standards are enforced. Is there a way for us, as a publisher, to get alerted if the policies deployed with the Managed application are violated and then quickly engage with the customers to ensure that their deployment is secure? 
 
The short answer was no, so we built one! 
We are open-sourcing the code for this solution so that other publishers can adopt this approach to ensure customers&#x27; Managed applications are secure. For more context on the solution described here please read Microsoft documentation on planning a Managed application and Azure Policy.

              Init Containers in Azure Container Apps : Database Initialization
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9861 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/init-containers-in-azure-container-apps-database-initialization/ba-p/3931271>Suppose you&#x27;re deploying a web application that relies on a database. Instead of manually configuring the database each time you deploy your application, you can use an Init Container to handle this task. The Init Container can run scripts to create tables, seed initial data, or set up the database schema. Once the database is ready, the main application container can safely start, knowing that the required database structure is in place.
 
The below example defines an init container which runs under the same pod as main app container, seeds data to an existing Azure MySQL Database which will be used by the main web app container to serve contents onto the landing page.
 

 
The init container inserts a record into an existing table named myguests in Azure My SQL DB using a python script. The script contains code for connecting to the Database alongside inserting record into the Database. This data will then be retrieved and used by the main app container which is also running a python Flask based web application and return the value in the landing page.
 
Dockerfile for Init Container
 
 
 
FROM python
COPY . .
RUN pip install mysql &amp;&amp; pip install mysql-connector-python
CMD [&quot;python&quot;, &quot;test.py&quot;]

 
 
 
 
Python Script for Init Container
 
 
 
import mysql.connector

mydb &#x3D; mysql.connector.connect(
  host&#x3D;&quot;init-test.mysql.database.azure.com&quot;,
  user&#x3D;&quot;*******&quot;,
  password&#x3D;&quot;*******&quot;,
  database&#x3D;&quot;*****&quot;
)

mycursor &#x3D; mydb.cursor()

sql &#x3D; &quot;INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES (&#x27;John&#x27;, &#x27;Doe&#x27;, &#x27;test@outlook.com&#x27;)&quot;

mycursor.execute(sql)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, &quot;record(s) affected&quot;)

 
 
 
 
Output from Init Container
 

 
 
 
Dockerfile for main app container

The last thing you want is for a code change or new feature to negatively impact your app&#x27;s performance. That&#x27;s where load testing swoops in to save the day. But what if we told you there&#x27;s an even cooler way to handle load testing? Yep, you guessed it – automating it with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Azure Pipelines and Azure Load Testing.
 
Why automate load tests with CI/CD?
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, let&#x27;s understand why automating load tests with CI/CD is a game-changer:

Detect issues early: By integrating load tests into your CI/CD pipeline, you can detect performance issues early . Address problems before they reach production, reducing the impact on end-users.

              Function app deployment from Azure DevOps never complete
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9791 words)</span>

When using zip deploy way to deploy to function app from Azure DevOps, the new deployment never complete at DevOps side until manually cancel it.
 
Bad: 

 
Good:

 
Resolution: 
1. Enable debug log at DevOps side and then check if there are many requests to &quot;/api/deployments/latest&quot; with 202, if yes, continue.  
2. Check under &quot;LogFiles/kudu/trace&quot; in kudu portal, find log with name like below at the same time range for current deployment. If many logs show the deployment is pending at same deployment id, then continue. 

3. Go to &quot;site/deployments&quot; in kudu portal to find the folder whose name is same as the deployment id, then check status.xml or status_complete.xml and log.log inside the folder. If status in status.xml or status_complete.xml is not Success or Failed, then we can try to resolve the issue by removing this folder under &quot;site/deployments&quot;.
4. Check the log with name like below under &quot;LogFiles/kudu/trace&quot; at the same time for the non-completed deployment task to get more details of the cause why the deployment at that time was not completed.</a>

              Init Containers in Azure Container Apps : File Processing
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9842 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/init-containers-in-azure-container-apps-file-processing/ba-p/3930675>In some scenarios, you might need to preprocess files before they&#x27;re used by your application. For instance, you&#x27;re deploying a machine learning model that relies on precomputed data files. An Init Container can download, extract, or preprocess these files, ensuring they are ready for the main application container. This approach simplifies the deployment process and ensures that your application always has access to the required data.
 
The below example defines a simple Pod that has an init container which downloads a file from some resource to a file share which is shared between the init and main app container. The main app container is running a php-apache image and serves the landing page using the index.php file downloaded into the shared file space.
 

 
The init container mounts the shared volume at /mydir , and the main application container mounts the shared volume at /var/www/html. The init container runs the following command to download the file and then terminates: wget -O /mydir/index.php http://info.cern.ch. 
 
Configurations and dockerfile for init container:
 

Mount the storage file share on the environment level
Create init container with mounting file share named init on path /mydir:


 
 

Dockerfile for init which downloads an index.php file under /mydir:

 
FROM busybox:1.28 
WORKDIR / 
ENTRYPOINT [&quot;wget&quot;, &quot;-O&quot;, &quot;/mydir/index.php&quot;, &quot;http://info.cern.ch&quot;]
 
 
 
Configuration for main app container:
 

Create main app container mounting file share named init on path /var/www/html:


 
 

Main app container configuration which uses php-apache image and serves the index.php file from DocumentRoot /var/www/html:


 
Output:

Azure Container App Init Containers are specialized containers that run to completion before application containers are started in a replica, and they can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in your container app image. Init containers are useful for performing initialization logic such as setting up accounts, running setup scripts, and configuring databases.
 
Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:

Init containers always run to completion.
Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.

This article will illustrate and provide detailed steps about how to setup an Application Gateway with an App Service behind a Private Endpoint. We will use a test domain and self-signed certificate for the Application Gateway to simulate a live environment.
 
In the diagram below, your client will connect to the application gateway through the public Ip address. The application gateway will connect privately and securely to your App Service application using a private endpoint which is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your private network.

A container image from an unknown source could include vulnerabilities and malicious code injected by bad actors. To mitigate container supply chain threats, enterprises and open-source communities are exploring safeguards. Signing container images enables software consumers to detect tampering and ensure the authenticity of the containerized workloads.

CD (Continuous Deployment) is a common way to pull the updated docker image from docker registry (such as Azure Continer Registray or Docker Hub etc) to App Service automatically.

 

While if App Service enables Private Endpoint, the webhook from container registry should be blocked with 403 since the public access to the App Service kudu site (advanced tool site) is blocked by default. And when webhook event is trying sent to app service via Private Endpoint, it should fail with IP forbidden.


 
With the situation, this blog provide a workaround by allowing webhook IP to access App Service kudu site via public access and keep the remaining traffic go through Private Endpoint. So the diagram as below:

This will help you understand the offering better before you make a long-term investment.
 



Note: This hosting plan is not suitable for Production workloads. So, it is highly recommended that you do not use this plan for production setup.

Application Configuration Service for VMware Tanzu (ACS) is one of the commercial VMware Tanzu components. It enables the management of Kubernetes-native ConfigMap resources that are populated from properties defined in one or more Git repositories.
 
Application Configuration Service is offered in two versions: Gen1 and Gen2. The Gen1 version mainly serves existing customers for backward compatibility purposes and is supported only until April 30, 2024. New service instances should use Gen2. The Gen2 version uses flux as the backend to communicate with Git repositories and provides better performance compared to Gen1.
 
You can check the generation information via Azure Portal

              How to detect Java dependency version conflict using IDEA Maven Helper
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 9847 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-detect-java-dependency-version-conflict-using-idea-maven/ba-p/3915091>A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.
 
1. Install the plugin
In IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.

 
2. Leverage the plugin
Open the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.

You will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.

 
3. Resolve conflict
To resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.
After resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.

 
4. Conclusion
Dependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/09/01/recently.html>Early this month I arrived at work to see a Concorde parked in the
Brooklyn Navy Yard. It’s
been fun to identify the ships docked there, but an airplane was new,
especially such a rare one. I guess a lot of airplane knowledge from
my childhood has stayed with me, and being greeted by this Concorde,
and watching the new Top Gun has brought it back.
This one’s G-BOAD,
the Concorde that’s been flown the most, and it usually lives at
the Intrepid, but
it badly needs a new coat of paint, so it’s in the Navy Yard for that.
Pretty fun! They brought it there on a barge.

The only great film I watched this month was Snatch.
Brad Pitt’s accent in the film, which is supposed to be that of an
Irish Traveller, is a big highlight.

In this blog post, we’ll cover how App Service users can navigate to Azure Load Testing amidst diagnosing performance bottlenecks.
 
Azure Load Testing is a fully managed load testing service that enables you to easily generate large-scale load. It provides actionable insights that can help identify performance, scalability and capacity issues. Azure customers can monitor their applications in Azure Load Testing during the load simulation to analyze the consumption of their resources.
 
Azure App Service helps you build and host web apps, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs in any programming language. However, it’s prudent to be prepared for any potentia…</a>

Below are few experiments with different configurations of Gunicorn. 
 

Create Python Flask App that sleeps for two seconds and responds with message &#x27;Finished&#x27;. This is to effectively mimic application making an outbound HTTP call or database call.
from flask import Flask
import time

app &#x3D; Flask(__name__)

@app.route(&#x27;/&#x27;)
def hello_world():
    time.sleep(2)
    return &quot;Finished&quot;

if __name__ &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;__main__&#x27;:
    app.run()​

Create script with 5 threads which will make 5 simultaneous HTTP calls to this Flask API.

In that post, we also stated that we would have another update in early 2023, but unfortunately this did not happen. However, we’ve made great progress since the last post, and today we’d like to share where we’re at with the isolated worker model, and how we’re thinking about the future.
 
Isolated worker model assessment
The isolated worker model you author your functions in a way that’s aligned with how the .NET ecosystem has evolved. It offers a rich dependency injection model, full control over main() and app dependencies, improved reliability, additional features like invocation middleware, and more. Our deepest than…</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/08/29/an-open-core.html>A few weeks ago, HashiCorp switched its default license for future product releases to the BSL license. The BSL license was created by the people at MariaDB in 2017 to give companies a way to release software as open source but prohibit their competitors from re-hosting that software and competing with them. In HashiCorp’s case, the license also has a stipulation that their code becomes simply liberally open source under the MPL, four years after it’s published under the BSL.
This prompted the usual outcry from the open source community, and some intelligent analysis. For the legal license analysis, you can do no better than reading Kyle E. Mitchell’s article and his summary of the strategy and list of the implementations at duallicensing.com.
