              Simulating desired throughput with Azure Load Testing

But what if you want to test the system to make sure it can handle a desired number of requests per second (RPS)¬†? For example, you may want to load test a payment gateway service for the number of transactions that can be processed every second. RPS or throughput is a crucial metric that reveals fundamental information about the tested system. Every system has a critical point in terms of throughput. Once the system reaches the critical point, it might keep the throughput around the same level, but the response times go up¬† or the requests get throttled.
In this article you‚Äôll learn how to:

Recently.
Reading
This month‚Äôs theme, looking back on it, was feminism, and so I read
Bad Sex, which was
on quite a few best-of-2022 lists. It was fine, but mostly whetted
my appetite for the books that it referenced. The
Right to Sex on
the other hand, was a perfect sort of thought-provoking thesis that
explored a bunch of surprising topics with a lot of intellectual
power.
I‚Äôve been experimenting with switching from my usual setup -
Feedbin for RSS and Instapaper
for read-it-later, in favor of Readwise Reader,
which does both, and more. Readwise feels flashy and has an

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/12/27/books.html>This year I read 22 books, which is about the average for the last few years. The
ratio of fiction to non-fiction was skewed toward non-fiction. I think overall
I read fewer amazing books than last year, when I finished 20, but also fewer
duds - though there certainly were some duds. Next year as always, I want to read more
and I‚Äôll probably dive back into fiction. You can find the whole list and
reviews in the /reading section. Here are the hits.
The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn by Suleiman Osman
My review, on IndieBound
This was the best book I read this year. It tells the story of the modern era of Brooklyn - that of real estate appreciation, displacement, redevelopment and preservation, NIMBYs and Robert Moses. Osman knits together history in a way that‚Äôs compelling but doesn‚Äôt ove‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-functions-openapi-extension-update/ba-p/3702128>Since the last update of v1.4.0, this Azure Functions OpenAPI extension has a lot of improvements. Here in this post, let&#x27;s discuss what improvements have been made.
Update ‚Äì v1.5.0
.NET 7 support for the isolated worker extension
According to the Azure Functions roadmap, Azure Functions isolated worker model has started supporting .NET 7. Therefore, this OpenAPI extension also starts supporting .NET 7 with the isolated worker model. The migration step is as easy as changing the target framework. Update your .csproj file and find the  node, and change it from netcoreapp3.1 (.NET Core 3.1), net5.0 (.NET 5) or net6.0 (.NET 6), to net7.0 (.NET 7).

You can now easily monitor your .NET applications on App Service Linux without changing your code by leveraging auto-instrumentation that is integrated into the App Services platform. With this feature enabled, the App Service platform will configure and attach a .NET application insights agent to your application runtime. This will allow application-level logs, metrics, and traces to flow into your Application Insights resource allowing you to understand how your .NET Linux application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.¬†

              Using Operation Results API to check the progress of deployment slots swap operation in App Service

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/using-operation-results-api-to-check-the-progress-of-deployment/ba-p/3641831>Currently there is no standard REST API to monitor swap operation, apart from using the activity logs.¬†
¬†
Web Apps - Swap Slot Slot - REST API (Azure App Service) | Microsoft Docs
¬†
However, we have recently found the following way to monitor the Swap operation and the same API is being used by Azure portal as well to update the Swap status and it&#x27;s comparatively fast. Please refer to the steps below:
¬†

First call the POST Slot-Swap API &amp; it will trigger the swap operation as shown below:

https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/slotsswap?api-version&#x3D;2022-03-01
¬†
¬†

¬†
2. The above API will have location parameter in Response Headers with Operation Results API call which can be used to continuously poll in a loop until the Response is 200 (Swap completed) or (failure status code in case of swap failure)
¬†
GET: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/operationresults/915677b6-ea92-44c9-865b-95cfc693d5bb?api-version&#x3D;2018-11-01
¬†
Polling: Swap in accepted/in-progress state:
¬†

¬†
Polling: Swap completed:
¬†

¬†
Thanks to¬†@DeependraChaudhary¬†for sharing the approach.
