              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/07/03/recently.html>Writing in from Washington, DC, my once-hometown and
the birthplace of Mapbox.
This one will be quick because I‚Äôm between one thing
and another!
Listening
Dry Daniel by Buke and Gase

Buke and Gase released some music they recorded a while ago,
and there are some hits in it. I especially love this
track ‚ÄòBubbles,‚Äô which really could be a radio hit.
I‚Äôve also been listening to Spellcaster: The Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried,
which will probably be only one of 20 podcasts, TV shows,
movies, books about SBF. But it‚Äôs pretty good.
Bloomberg puts out good content!
Reading
I read Capital Without Borders,
which is a great add-on if you‚Äôve already read Piketty‚Äôs Capital
or anything by Zucman, Saez, etc. It really gives you a level-headed
perspective of what exactly the wealth management industry does,
and how it affects the word.
Right now, I‚Äôm reading Crabgrass Kingdom,
which I found via the New York Times piece on Vienna.
It‚Äôs pretty good, but unfortunately kind of dated - when it was
published in the 80s, US cities hadn‚Äôt started their arc back
toward growth and power. Still pretty good, though!
The Vienna piece is also highly recommended. Very few commentators
have said so clearly that we can‚Äôt fix America‚Äôs housing problems
without letting go of our obsession with owning houses as investments.
The Henry George Program
did, but of course they would.
Watching
I watched some trash this month - The Terminator,
They Live, and Next.
Unfortunately, I think I ran out of the good Nic Cage movies
four movies ago and it‚Äôs a slog to watch all the rest.
Only 22% done with watching the whole Cage filmography.</a>

Azure Load Testing already supports tools like SDKs, Azure DevOps and GitHub extensions.

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for working with data, code, and visualization. Azure App Service is a platform for hosting web applications in the cloud. In this blog post, we will discuss how to deploy JupyterLab to Azure App Service using the official Docker image in Docker Hub.
¬†
Deploying JupyterLab to Azure App Service
To deploy JupyterLab to Azure App Service, we will use the Docker image¬†jupyter/scipy-notebook¬†hosted in Docker Hub, which contains JupyterLab and all its dependencies.
1. First, create an Azure App Service. To do this, go to the Azure portal, select &quot;App Services,&quot; and click &quot;Add&quot; to create an app service. Make sure to select &quot;Docker Container&quot; as the publish option and &quot;Linux&quot; as the operating system.

              TeX Live package reorganization

            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/tex-live-package-reorganization/>Starting from version 2023.66594-9, TeX Live packages have been reorganized to mirror upstream collections. Even though the new texlive-basic replaces the old texlive-core, many of the texlive-core contents (including language specific files) are now split between different packages. To find out which Arch package contains a specific CTAN package, you can use the tlmgr utility, eg.
$ tlmgr info euler | grep collection
collection:  collection-latexrecommended

which means the euler CTAN package is contained in texlive-latexrecommended. You may also use pacman -F to query for specific files.
A new metapackage texlive-meta is available to install all subpackages (except for language specific ones), and the new texlive-doc package provides the full documentation for offline use.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/openblas-0323-2-update-requires-manual-intervention/>The openblas package prior to version 0.3.23-2 doesn&#x27;t ship optimized
LAPACK routine and CBLAS/LAPACKE interfaces for compatibility. This
decision has been reverted now, and the ability to choose a different
default system BLAS/LAPACK implementation while keeping openblas
installed is now provided to allow future co-installation of BLIS,
ATLAS, etc.
The default BLAS implementation will be used for most packages like
NumPy or R. Please install &quot;blas-openblas&quot; and &quot;blas64-openblas&quot; to make
OpenBLAS the default BLAS implementation, just like the old behavior.
Unfortunately you will get errors on updating if you currently have
OpenBLAS installed as the default BLAS implementation:
error: failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies)
:: installing openblas (0.3.23-2) breaks dependency &#x27;blas&#x27; required by cblas
:: installing openblas (0.3.23-2) breaks dependency &#x27;blas&#x27; required by
lapack
Please append your preferred default BLAS implementation to the regular
-Syu command line to get around it. For example:
pacman -Syu blas-openblas

or
pacman -Syu blas</a>

Whether you are launching a new application or getting ready for peak traffic, load testing helps you ensure that your database can handle the load and deliver reliable performance.

Introduction¬†

Recently I am having an increasing number of conversations with customers on how best to manage container images in disconnected or highly restricted environments. Cluster security is becoming increasingly more important, a 2023 report by Red Hat showed that 90% of enterprises surveyed had experienced a security incident in their Kubernetes environments in the last 12 months.

There is certainly a trend from customers recently to harden environments making the most of Azure Services such as Azure Firewall to manage egress traffic or Network security groups to restrict traffic within an Azure Subscription.

¬†

¬†
A common problem encountered when having Azure App Service behind Azure Application Gateway is
whether we can use the cookie-based affinity feature on Azure Application Gateway end instead to maintain session stickiness.
¬†

¬†
Answer is NO. Because as explained at Azure - Inside the Azure App Service Architecture | Microsoft Learn Azure App Service is distributed system 
and has its own frontend workers and backend workers, 
enabling cookie-based affinity on Application Gateway side only allows requests from the same end user to 
get routed to the same App Service frontend workers within a session 
and we still need the ARR Affinity ‚Ä¶</a>
