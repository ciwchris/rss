Customers may want to list all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoints, and enable Network Security Group for the Private Endpoints.
There is no way to do it from Azure portal. But the below Power shell script can help customers list all the subnets used for Private Endpoints.
 

List all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoint using PowerShell script

$privateEndpoints &#x3D; Get-AzPrivateEndpoint
$subnetIds &#x3D; $privateEndpoints | ForEach-Object { $_.Subnet.Id }
$uniqueSubnetIds &#x3D; $subnetIds | Sort-Object -Unique
 
foreach ($subnetId in $uniqueSubnetIds) {
    Get-AzResource -ResourceId $subnetId
}
 
The output is like this 

 

Regarding more parameters for Get-AzPrivateEndpoint

         Check Get-AzPrivateEndpoint (Az.Network) | Microsoft Learn
 

How To Enable Network Security Group for Private Endpoints 
By default, network policies are disabled for a subnet in a virtual network.
You need to assign the NSG name first in this subnet, then enable NSG in “Network Policy for Private Endpoint”, then the PE will be applied the NSG rule.

For this, we will be using Microsoft Azure App Service, a PaaS (platform as a service) offering by Microsoft Azure, because it&#x27;s quite suitable for long running applications and web workloads.
 
As we want our application to be fully-managed and scaling automatically in the cloud, MongoDB Atlas is a great choice for our data store since it’s a fully-managed, cloud-native database as a service that can also scale up and down automatically in a cost-effective way to meet the needs of any application.

By default, Azure Spring App uses Azure DNS for name resolution. However, in some cases, you may want to use custom DNS servers for name resolution. This article explains how to configure custom DNS for Azure Spring App in a private network.
 
Suggestions for Using Custom DNS.


Set up less than 3 custom DNS servers. 


         Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses the CoreDNS project for cluster DNS management and resolution. Based on observation, it only takes the first three custom DNS server settings. If you specify more than three custom DNS servers, AKS will only use the first three. 
         


Make sure that all custom DNS servers have same records that all of them could resolv…</a>

Having the ability to identify clear root cause for incidents in production workloads is valuable, the best way to prevent future incidents is to understand what caused past ones. Of course you can have a good set of load tests but still, incidents in production environments can happen and it&#x27;s crucial to have available data that can help to understand what happened so application can be improved and prevent replications.
In this article we will learn how to use Application Insights and automatic profiler to find root cause for past incidents and prepare logging platform to ensure meaningful data for analysis.

The good news is that you don’t need to go full-on cloud native all at once. Azure App Service offers a comprehensive platform for hosting .NET applications in the cloud with minimal code changes needed to the existing web app.
In this article I want to talk about how Azure App Service makes an excellent first step for a .NET application’s cloud journey. By the end of this article, I want you to have enough information to have a foundation for taking your taking your app to the cloud – and honestly to decide whether it’s the right decision at all.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/storing-app-service-application-logs-in-blob/ba-p/3800963>Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service web app. The primary aim of this blog is to guide one step-by-step to add instrumentation to your application, as well as how to access the information logged.
 
Step 1:
Go to &gt;App Service Logs&gt; Enable Application Logging (Blob) and select the desired Blob Storage and the Container and select the Level of logging.
 

 
For more information on different types of logs you can refer this document.
 
Step 2:
Below is the code we have deployed a .Net Core MVC web application in a Windows App Service.
 
 
 public IActionResult Index()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation(&quot;This is a test to send logs to : Blob &quot;);

            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }
 
 
Below are different level of logs details which you can log:
 

 




Note: If you write logs to blobs, the retention policy no longer applies if you delete the app but keep the logs in the blobs. For more information, see Costs that might accrue after resource deletion.




 
Step 3:
Go to Storage Account&gt; Container and select the folder with your app service name and download the ( .txt ) file to check the logs.
 

 
The Blob option also includes additional information in the log messages, such as the ID of the origin VM instance of the log message (InstanceId), thread ID (Tid), and a more granular timestamp (EventTickCount) in a ( .csv ) file.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice. Or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…</a>

Azure Resource Graph is an Azure service designed to extend Azure Resource Management by providing efficient and performant resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across a given set of subscriptions so that you can effectively govern your environment.
These queries provide the following abilities:

Query resources with complex filtering, grouping, and sorting by resource properties.
Explore resources iteratively based on governance requirements.
Assess the impact of applying policies in a vast cloud environment.
Query changes made to resource properties (preview).

Below are few resource types supported by Azure Resource Graph:

It is the next evolution of a public preview feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), that is built on the now deprecated pod identity project. Azure AD Workload Identity, is simpler to use and replaces pod identity. Azure AD Workload Identity on AKS is now generally available so customers can run production workloads using Workload Identity on both Windows and Linux and migrate applications using Pod Identity over to Workload Identity. 
 
Azure AD Workload Identity leverages Service Account Token Volume Projection giving pods the ability to use a Kubernetes identity (service account), to which a Kubernetes token is issued and OIDC federation which enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory based on annotated service accounts.
 
Since the open-source pod identity project is now deprecated, AKS will continue to support the AKS pod identity through 2023. To ease the transition, customers can run Pod Identity and Workload Identity in parallel on an existing AKS cluster.  Please note that during the Public Preview we enabled the sidecar to give customers time to update their SDKs, but this is not a supported configuration for General Availability. We recommend that customers update applications to a list of supported SDKs that will allow applications to talk to the AAD endpoint.</a>

With workloads configured to consume only the necessary resources and dynamically scale to meet demand, businesses can optimize resource usage while reducing downtime. Additionally, Kubernetes allows organizations to deploy multiple applications from various teams or business units to a single cluster, resulting in significantly reduced infrastructure costs. However, this multitenancy approach poses a new challenge.
 
Consider this scenario: your cluster generates $100/day in infrastructure spend with a shared set of resources split across 10 developer teams. If 1 team consumes 80% of the cluster’s resources, it does not make sense to split infrastructure costs evenly across all teams at $10/day. Instead, your organ…</a>

Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. 
 
Azure App Service provides a highly scalable, self-patching web hosting service. This blog shows you how to create and map the custom Domain Name System (DNS) name contains a special unicode character to App Service using Azure CLI.
 
Problem:
 
If you try to create and bind the custom domain containing special Unicode character in Azure App Service using Azure CLI with the below command it will throw the following error:
 
Azure CLI Command:
 
az appservice domain create --contact-info

This blog will guide you step-by-step to enable AppServiceHTTPLogs , AppServiceAppLogs and view them in Log Analytics.
 
Step 1:
Go to Azure Portal &gt; App Service &gt; Diagnostic Settings and enable the required settings you would like to send to the destination . In this blog I have taken an example of HTTP Logs and App Service Application Logs in a Windows App Service ( .Net Core ).
 

 
You can refer this doc for more details on supported log types.
 
Step 2:
In your application code you can use the usual logging options and send log messages to application logs. By default, ASP.NET Core uses the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices logging provider. For more information, see ASP.NET Core logging in Azure.
 
Below is the code snippet of the logging I am doing in my .Net Core MVC webapp.
 

 
 
Step 3:
Go to Azure Portal &gt; Log Analytics workspace &gt; Logs and query the AppServiceAppLogs table and you can see the logs being sent. You can use different levels of logging such as Error, Information, Verbose and etc. in your application and this will show up in your logs in Log Analytics under the “Level” field. You can filter out logs based on the level:
 

 
Similarly, you can also query AppServiceHTTPLogs:
 

 
Sample Queries in Log Analytics:
 




AppServiceAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated &gt;ago(10m)
 
AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where TimeGenerated &gt;ago(10m)




 
 
More information:

AppServiceAppLogs is now available for ASP .NET apps on Windows - Azure App Service

Therefore, they usually enable private endpoint as well as configure Access Restriction to deny all the public traffic.
 
When the private endpoint is enabled and public traffic is denied to the web app, all the public traffic to this app is cut off. Since there is a range of IP addresses where agents are deployed, they have a public IP. Obviously, these agents are unable to reach web app.

 
As a solution, we can either allow the IP ranges list in the firewall or use self-hosted agents to deploy.

You can implement the server thumbprint in the .NET application code to resolve “Remote certificate is invalid” when multi-tenant web app is configured as client in client-server model and making HTTS request to a server configured with a private CA.
 
When a web app acts as a client and makes an HTTPS call to an external server secured by a private CA, the web app uses its default installed trusted root CA’s public key to validate the server’s certificate. However, the remote server certificate is signed by a private CA, and since there is no such trusted CA in the web app’s trusted source list, it will not be validated by the web app. You cannot modify th…</a>

This structure is designed to adapt compute options to individual apps and microservices components for more flexible microservices solutions. Azure Container Apps now supports a Dedicated plan in addition to the existing serverless Consumption plan.
 
The Dedicated plan guarantees single tenancy and specialized compute options including memory-optimized choices. In addition, the new Dedicated plan runs in the same Azure Container Apps environment as the serverless Consumption plan. This allows apps or microservice components that may have different resource requirements depending on component purpose or development stack to run in the same Azure Container Apps environment.  An…</a>

Azure Load Testing (ALT) provides a unified dashboard of test statistics, client-side metrics, and server-side metrics so that the performance bottlenecks can be easily identified. While the out of the box dashboard is helpful in most scenarios, you might want the load test results to be available in a tool of your choice –

What is WordPress Multisite?
 
WordPress Multisite is a feature of WordPress that enables you to run and manage multiple WordPress websites using the same WordPress installation. You could update multiple websites in a single click by using the parent WordPress dashboard, and even manage individual sites through their individual dashboards. This feature was previously called WordPress Multi-User.
 
For example, a multinational e-commerce store can create multiple country-specific subsites in the same WordPress installation using this feature. The root admin can install plugins and themes required for all the websites at once. They can also assign different admins to each subsite. A lot of our customers use the multisite feature for various scenar…</a>

In this tutorial I will walk you through:
 

setting up a new Blazor project,
creating a new page with a simple UI,
creating data in MongoDB Atlas,
showing those news on the website and
making the website available by using Azure App Service to host it.

 
All you need is this tutorial and the following pre-requisites, but if you prefer to just read along for now, check out the GitHub repository for this tutorial where you can find the code and the tutorial.

Install the GD extension with Webp support using the below command.

apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps autoconf pkgconfig gcc g++ gawk make zlib-dev libpng-dev libwebp-dev \
&amp;&amp; docker-php-ext-configure gd --with-webp \
&amp;&amp; docker-php-ext-install gd \
&amp;&amp; apk del .build-deps
Copy the newly installed gd.so file to a persistent file storage. 
mkdir -p /home/dev/extensions
cp /usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20200930/gd.so /home/dev/extensions/gd.so
 

Now write a post-startup script to restore the updated copy of gd.so everytime the app starts.

Edit the startup script file in /home/dev directory using the below command: 
vi /home/dev/startup.sh
Then add the following command to the startup.sh file and save it (type :wq to save).
 
cp /home/dev/extensions/gd.so /usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20200930/gd.so 
 

Now restart your app from Azure Portal and you can upload a sample .webp image to test the changes.</a>

              Addressing Cache Retrieval Failures on Azure App Service - Node-Cache Example

However, the module worked fine on my local environment, single virtual machine, or single-instance app service.
 
This behavior occurs because Node-Cache and other private cache solutions are designed to store data in the memory of a single process. The private cache works properly when running on a single instance, as all requests are handled by the same process and have access to the same cache.
 

However, in a multi-instance environment like a multi-instance App Service, using a private cache can lead to inconsistent behavior and data inconsistency.
 
For example, you save a value in one cache in an instance. Then, a request tries to read th…</a>

Examples of MIME types:

text/javascript for JavaScript files.
text/markdown for Markdown files.
application/octet-stream for binary files where user action is expected.

Server default configurations vary wildly and set different default MIME-type values for files with no defined content type. As new content types are invented or added to web servers, the users may fail to add the new MIME types to their web server&#x27;s configuration.

Listening
Gift from the Trees by Mammal Hands

I am still really loving the constellation of bands around
Mammal Hands. They just released
a new album, “Gift from the Trees”, and it’s really excellent.
RETURN by tAKX

Their guitarist, Stephen Mullins, also just released an excellent
album that has more of a Fennesz
direction - guitar-based ambient.
Watching
Of course I watched Succession, and it was good. I also watched
four movies - the best being Nope,
which delivered on all the levels. The rest were more uneven:
The Neon Demon is
a “vibes movie”, Triangle of Sadness
was sort of an overdone, kind of tedious satire, and I disliked
how much I liked This is the End.
It started sometime in the pandemic, but my already-bad taste in movies
has gotten even…</a>
