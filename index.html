Scale up: Get more CPU, memory, disk space, and extra features. You scale up by changing the pricing tier of the App Service plan that your app belongs to.
Scale out: Increase the number of VM instances that run your app. You can scale out to as many as 30 instances, depending on your pricing tier.¬†App Service Environments¬†in¬†Isolated¬†tier further increases your scale-out count to 100 instances. You can scale manually or automatically based on predefined rules and schedules.

These existing scaling workflows work well, but you may want to instead have the App Service platform automatically scale your web app without the hassle of defining auto-scaling rules &amp; schedules.

¬†
Today, we‚Äôd like to announce¬†the¬†Docker Compose Language Service in the Docker Extension for VS Code.¬†That‚Äôs right, the Docker Extension will now provide Docker Compose files with IntelliSense,¬†Tooltips, and syntax validation. Here are a few of the incoming features in¬†our 1.18 release:¬†
¬†

IntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)


¬†

Tooltips for Compose keywords (i.e.¬†services, image)¬†



Right-click¬†to¬†format¬†a Compose file¬†(Shift + Alt + F)¬†
YAML Syntax Validation¬†
Hyperlinks for Docker Images¬†

In our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!
¬†
There are more improvements to come!¬†Stay¬†tuned¬†for these features:

More tab completions
Docker Compose schema validation¬†
‚Ä¶ and much more!¬†

We love your feedback! If you have any comments¬†or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the¬†Compose Language Service Repo¬†or the¬†VS Code Docker Repo¬†for general feedback.</a>

The study, completed in an animal model and published in October in the Journal of Dental Research, found that excessive inflammation resulting from obesity raises the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), a group of immune cells that increase during illness to regulate immune function.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/11/211111130332.htm>Research suggested that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be at least partly caused by differences in the composition of the gut microbiota, based on the observation that certain types of microbes are more common in people with autism. But a new study suggests that the link may actually work the other way around: the diversity in species found in the guts of children with autism may be due to their restricted dietary preferences associated with autism, rather than the cause of their symptoms.</a>

The albino mice carry a mutation in the tyrosinase gene leading to a deficiency of melanin synthesis. NASH is a serious illness in humans, and the identification of the involvement of tyrosinase in NASH development will guide future research into this condition.</a>
