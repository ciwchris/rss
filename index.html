              How to set blob storage firewall accessing from app service only
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9497 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-set-blob-storage-firewall-accessing-from-app-service-only/ba-p/3638851>Scenario
Goal: Blob storage can access only from the app service.So, you want to set the blob storage firewall for inbound traffic.
¬†
Blob storage firewall limitation in this scenario
1. IP address
¬†IP network rules have no effect on requests originating from the same Azure region as the storage account.
¬†See¬†Grant access from an internet IP range¬†
2. Service tag
¬†There isn&#x27;t an App service tag.

¬†
ps. When clients request blob storage through app service, blob storage receives not App service IP but Client IP.
¬†
Workaround
1. Add IP address when app service and storage are located in a different region.
When resources are located in a different region, the IP address firewall setting works.
2. Firewall with Virtual Network
When blob storage uses VNet firewall, app service must be integrated with VNet.
If you want to read what is VNet integration, see¬†VNet integration¬†

¬†
Before setting VNet integration, you must check limitations.
Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
¬†
1. Set Vnet Integration on the app service
Add VNet to your app service.
I use &quot;firwall-storage-vnet&quot; VNet as below.
¬†

¬†
2. Blob storage firewall setting with VNet which is integrated with app service

3. If you use a function app, please add WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET &#x3D; 1
A value of¬†1¬†enables your function app to scale when you have your storage account restricted to a virtual network.¬†
You can see the detail about this setting¬†website_contentovervnet</a>

              Universal rendering with Nuxt 3 and Azure Static Web Apps
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9551 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/universal-rendering-with-nuxt-3-and-azure-static-web-apps/ba-p/3586297>Azure Static Web Apps automatically builds and deploys dozens of frontend frameworks, one of them is Nuxt. Today, we&#x27;re excited to share that you can deploy Nuxt 3 applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps.
¬†
While Nuxt 2 is known for its ease of use, Nuxt 3 brings even faster performance and improved developer experience with a thrilling new set of underlying technologies and features. With the release of Nuxt 3‚Äôs release candidate in April 2022, developers witnessed a complete re-architect of the framework. Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge¬†also work with Azure Static Web Apps.
¬†
What‚Äôs new in Nuxt 3?¬†
¬†

Zero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps¬†
API routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories¬†
Vue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability¬†
Nitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static¬†
Vite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production¬†

Universal rendering vs static rendering
¬†
Previously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.
¬†
With Nuxt 3&#x27;s support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering.¬†
¬†
To learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.

The dehumidifiers turned off, the humidifiers on. The A/C off,
the heat on. I‚Äôm still, more than a year after leaving the west coast,
grateful for the presence of seasons to keep me aware of time passing,
but now I‚Äôm aware of time passing.

I got some film photos back, out of my Hasselblad and Olympus XA-2
cameras. This time both rolls had some good photos on them. Taking
the film out of the Hasselblad, I broke one of the light seals, again,
so I have to fix it, again. There‚Äôs a man who sells a kit to fix
the seal on eBay - a piece of mylar and a few tiny slices of foam.
It works. He must do some robust business, given how easily
those parts seem to break.

              Application Insights Sampling in Azure Functions and missing invocations
              <span class="post-metadata">(31 min | 9346 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/application-insights-sampling-in-azure-functions-and-missing/ba-p/3641491>For Azure Functions -
¬†

Adaptive sampling is enabled by default.
Fixed-rate sampling is not supported.
Ingestion sampling only applies when no other sampling is in effect. Therefore, this is also disabled by default in the wake of point #1 above.

¬†
¬†
If you expect data (invocations) under Monitor but do not find it as shown in screenshot below, you have either changed Host.Results category to Warning (or above) level; or your application telemetry is getting sampled. To fix the former, open Host.json file and change the Host.Results category to Information level.
¬†
{
¬† &quot;logging&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬† &quot;fileLoggingMode&quot;: &quot;always&quot;,
¬†¬†¬† &quot;logLevel&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;default&quot;: &quot;Information&quot;,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Host.Results&quot;: &quot;Information&quot;,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Function&quot;: &quot;Error&quot;,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Host.Aggregator&quot;: &quot;Trace&quot;
¬†¬†¬† }
¬† }
}
¬†
¬†
If Host.Results category is already set at Information level, disable telemetry sampling as the next step.
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†
To disable the sampling, set &quot;isEnabled&quot;: false in host.json file as shown below -
¬†
{
¬† &quot;logging&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬† &quot;applicationInsights&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;samplingSettings&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;isEnabled&quot;: false
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† }
¬†¬†¬† }
¬† }
}
¬†
After disabling sampling, you can confirm it by running a query similar to the following; RetainedPercentage should show 100%.
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
At this point, the function invocations should start appearing under Monitor on Azure Portal UI.</a>

¬†
Node.js has two module systems:
1)¬†¬†CommonJS¬†modules and
2)¬† ECMAScript modules.
¬†
1) CommonJS: The de facto standard for modules in Node.js currently¬† is CommonJS. CommonJS modules are defined in normal .js files using¬†module.exports or .cjs.
Modules can be used later within other .js files with the¬†require()¬†function.
Import using require (Common JS) :
¬†
// foo.js
module.exports &#x3D; function() {
  return &#x27;Hello foo!&#x27;;
}

// index.js
var foo &#x3D; require(&#x27;./foo&#x27;);
console.log(foo()); // Hello foo!

Today, we are announcing the preview of passwordless connections for Java applications to Azure database and eventing services, letting you finally shift away from using passwords.

Security Challenges with Passwords
¬†
Passwords should be used with caution, and developers must never place passwords in an unsecured location. Many Java applications connect to backend data, cache, messaging, and eventing services using usernames and passwords, or other sensitive credentials such as access tokens or connection strings. If exposed, the passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as a sales catalog that you built for an upcoming campaig‚Ä¶</a>

If you still have python2 installed on your system consider removing it and any python2 package.
If you still require the python2 package you can keep it around, but please be aware that there will be no security updates. If you need a patched package please consult the AUR, or use an unofficial user repository.</a>

              Client Side Decryption on Azure Spring Apps
              <span class="post-metadata">(31 min | 9449 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/client-side-decryption-on-azure-spring-apps/ba-p/3621622>You can use client side decryption of properties on Azure Spring Apps by following the steps below:
Add the encrypted property in your¬†.properties¬†file in your git repository.It would look like:


message&#x3D;{cipher}f43e3df3862ab196a4b367624a7d9b581e1c543610da353fbdd2477d60fb282f


Update the Config Server on Azure Spring App to use the git repository which has our encrypted property. You could do it directly from Azure Portal or use¬†Azure CLI:
az spring-cloud config-server git set -n myspringcloud --uri 

In your Spring Boot application, add the decryption key in the¬†bootstrap.yml¬†file. (You would need to create it if it does not exist)


encrypt:
  key: somerandomkey



[This is the key you would have used in order to encrypt your property earlier]Now, add some code to get the value of the encrypted property.


package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {

    @Value(&quot;${message:default}&quot;) 
    String message;

    @GetMapping(&quot;/&quot;)
    public String hello() {
        return message;
    }

}



Create an App, or deploy to an existing one.
az spring-cloud app create -n 

¬†
Deploy your app.
az spring-cloud app deploy -n appName --jar-path 

¬†
Assign a public endpoint (or use the Test Endpoints)
az spring-cloud app update -n appName --assign-endpoint true

¬†
Access your application to view the value.
https://-.azuremicroservices.io/

¬†
(Optional) You can check the encrypted values on the Config Server by following the steps mentioned in thisdocumentation:¬†https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-access-data-plane-azure-ad-rbac</a>

There are two ways in which you could run a shell script in WordPress on Azure App Service.

The start-up File ‚Äì run shell commands and scripts that need to be persistent

1. Using Web SSH
As we have mentioned earlier, web SSH can be used to run commands and scripts that are non-persistent. For example, navigating folders, reading the contents of a file, or echoing a message. Here, we will learn how to echo ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù in web SSH.

yesterday. It‚Äôs a port of a project I did in 2013,
in JavaScript. It‚Äôs the first time in a while I‚Äôve made
a project just for kicks. If you look at the number of
GitHub repositories I‚Äôve committed to since 2013, the
number is decreasing. Same with number of commits, but
that‚Äôs almost entirely because in 2017 I learned
how to use amend
to combine my haphazard commits into logical chunks.

And, sure, another element of this trend is that I stopped
working on so many tiny npm modules
and instead worked on applications.
But systematic factors aside ‚Äì what you see here is focus.
Especially since committing to building Placemark,

In a previous post, we introduced the isolated process model, which decouples your function code from the core Azure Functions host, in contrast to the traditional model where we run them together in the same process. Functions V4 supports .NET 6 in both models, and the isolated process model also supports .NET 7 (public preview) and Framework 4.8 (public preview). In this update, we‚Äôll re-cap some of our recent updates, outline some changes to look forward to, and expand on our thinking about future versions.

We will provide another roadmap update in early 2023.

Create your keys using the following command on your terminal


ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;test@mymail.com&quot;



This will create a public key (.pub) and a private key.
Copy the public key on GitHub
Go to your GitHub account -&gt; Settings -&gt; SSH and GPG keys Click on¬†New SSH key¬†and copy the public key here.
Configure the Config Server on Azure Spring Apps
Go to the Azure Spring Apps Service -&gt; Config ServerSpecify the GitHub URL, Label etc. and choose SSH as the Authentication protocol. Copy your private key in the text box and save.

(Optional) To ensure that the key works, you can test it on the local system as well.
Refer:¬†Clone GitHub Repository using SSH


eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;

ssh-add 

git clone 
#Example of the URL: git@github.com:username/testconfig.git



You should now have access to your private GitHub Repository via SSH from Azure Spring Apps.</a>

jcmd  Thread.print &gt; /home/threaddump
Similarly, to collect the heap dump, run:jcmd  GC.heap_dump /home/heapdump

Note:
The files under /home are only persistent by default. Consider collecting the dumps under /home or in the mounted location for External Storage (if using BYOS)</a>

We built a lot of stuff together at Mapbox, from iD
to Mapbox Studio. But he was
insistent that after this job, he was going to make games and comics.
No more tech rocket ships.
He‚Äôs gone and done it. Saman, along with Micah Fitch and Tom Lubanovic, released
Wilderplace today. It‚Äôs an endlessly creative
turn-based adventure game.

It‚Äôs been in the works since 2019, and has all the marks of
a gesamkunstwerk.
Everything is handmade, from the hand-drawn animations to the fonts,
which Saman created from scratch and released on GitHub.

Micah wrote a soundtrack that organically combines motifs as you progress
through the game, and uses the still pretty cutting-edge web audio tech to
emulate synthesizers.


I‚Äôve been lucky to play beta versions of the game, but it‚Äôs progressed
really far in the last year. You can play it with a game controller, it has
this inventory system, it‚Äôs all a pretty impressive technical achievement,
on top of a fun game. And now it‚Äôs released, and you
can buy it on Steam
or check out wilderplace.place.</a>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they&#x27;d been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.</a>

The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population&#x27;s increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.</a>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.</a>

In addition, the scientists found that a diet with an increased proportion of unsaturated fatty acids leads to a reduction in risk-associated lipids and an increase in low-risk lipids.</a>

Male baby pregnancies are more likely to result in complications, possibly because they grow faster in the womb and require more nutrients and oxygen than supplied by the mother through the placenta -- the temporary organ that attaches to the wall of the uterus during pregnancy to help the fetus grow and develop.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220426101641.htm>A study is the first to examine if sex significantly affects cognitive outcomes in people who follow individually-tailored, multi-domain clinical interventions. The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals&#x27; overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.</a>
