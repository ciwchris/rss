Now, researchers have found that while these efforts have been effective, the incidence of higher-grade disease and metastasis at diagnosis have risen.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220421100149.htm>Dentures may have a potentially negative impact on a person&#x27;s overall nutrition, according to new research. The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals&#x27; overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.</a>

The identity is managed by the Azure platform and does not require you to provision or rotate any secrets.
We have two types of Managed Identities:

System-assigned Identity
User-assigned Identity

You can read about Managed Identity for App Service and Azure Functions here.
Below are the steps for the configuration:

You can create an App Service or an Azure Function and use the code example below to retrieve the token using the Azure Identity client library via System-assigned identity:

              Add a Default Error Page in web.xml for Java app in Windows App Service
              <span class="post-metadata">(3 min | 891 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/add-a-default-error-page-in-web-xml-for-java-app-in-windows-app/ba-p/3286691>App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.
¬†
Before talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let&#x27;s discuss &quot;what is web.xml&quot;?
¬†
Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named¬†web.xml and resides in the app&#x27;s WAR under the¬†WEB-INF/¬†directory.¬†web.xml¬†is part of the servlet standard for web applications.
¬†
The default¬†Servlet configurations is under¬†${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under¬†${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.
¬†
When tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application.¬†
¬†
It instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.
There you specify:

what servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to
listeners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)
configuration parameters (context-params)
error pages, welcome files
security constraints

Back to our topic, if you haven&#x27;t defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:

¬†
To add a custom error page, please follow below steps:

Add  in web.xml under¬†webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page &quot;error.html&quot; is under root folder /webapp, so I should use &quot;/error.html&quot; in .



Add your custom error in webapps folder.



Build and re-deploy the project to App Service.
Now you will see the custom error page replace the default one.


¬†
Please kindly note, configurations won&#x27;t take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.</a>

They teased a dashcam hardware in 2020, and announced the crypto angle in 2022.
The idea of individuals contributing streetview-like imagery with a dashcam is not new. Mapillary did exactly that starting in 2013, established a large dataset and active community in a few years, and sold to Facebook in 2020.
What follows is a quick review of what is currently available about Hivemapper‚Äôs new phase:

The findings point to the possibility of new therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative diseases, which are relatively common in older adults and so far have no effective, disease-modifying treatments.</a>

The App Service VNet integration feature enables your apps to access resources in or through a virtual network but doesn&#x27;t grant inbound private access to your apps. For inbound access, you need private endpoints, which allow clients located in your private network to securely access your apps over Private Link, which eliminates exposure from the public internet.

With this update, you can use our lower-cost tiers and achieve the same level of security that you could previously only achieve with our high-end SKUs.

Learn how to enable virtual network integration.

Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re building a microservices architecture. It typically consists of an API gateway and many API apps, which are Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Functions API in this example. The microservices architecture might be more complex depending on the requirements, but it&#x27;s way too far from our topic. Therefore, let&#x27;s build a minimal structure that is working.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220408083901.htm>Scientists have developed a new technique for rejuvenating skin cells. This technique has allowed researchers to rewind the cellular biological clock by around 30 years according to molecular measures, significantly longer than previous reprogramming methods. The partially rejuvenated cells showed signs of behaving more like youthful cells in experiments simulating a skin wound. This research, although in early stages, could eventually have implications for regenerative medicine, especially if it can be replicated in other cell types.</a>

The results showed that total fiber, and more specifically cereal fiber but not fruit or vegetable fiber, was consistently associated with lower inflammation and lower CVD incidence. Until now there had been limited data on the link between fiber and inflammation among older adults, who have higher levels of inflammation compared with younger adults.</a>

Although not currently intended for clinical use, the team hopes the charts will become a routine clinical tool similar to how standardised paediatric growth charts are used.</a>

These urges --known as cravings-- are very common, especially during pregnancy. During this time, the mother&#x27;s body undergoes a series of physiological and behavioral changes to create a favorable environment for the embryo&#x27;s development. However, the frequent consumption of tasty and high calorie foods -- derived from the cravings -- contributes to weight gain and obesity in pregnancy, which can have negative effects on the baby&#x27;s health.</a>

The researchers also collected urine samples, most of which contained secondary metabolites of ethanol. The results provide further evidence that our primate ancestors preferentially sought out fermented, alcohol-containing fruit likely for its greater nutritional value, and that humans may have inherited this proclivity for ethanol.</a>

A new study with more than 200 participants now provides insights into the interaction of these pathological phenomena. The data suggest that tau load in the brain impairs memory functions only when amyloid burden is also high. These findings therefore support therapeutic approaches aimed at removing amyloid from the brain in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220329114719.htm>New research is breaking ground in repurposing an FDA-approved drug as a potential treatment in Down syndrome and normal aging. The results suggest that GM-CSF may improve cognitive function in people with Down syndrome. The drug sargramostim (GM-CSF, which stands for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) is also the first to show memory improvement in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients in a phase II¬†clinical trial. GM-CSF is a normal human protein that is safe and well-tolerated with over 30 years of FDA-approved use for other disorders.</a>

A decade ago, I honestly believed I‚Äôd learn a few things, achieve what I wanted, and settle into a sort of non-striving creative flow for the rest of my days.

We become more susceptible to infections and vaccinations no longer work as effectively. A research team has investigated whether short-lived killifish also undergo aging of the immune system. Indeed, they found that as early as four months of age, killifish have less diverse circulating antibodies compared to younger fish, which may contribute to a generalized decrease in the immune function.</a>

The researchers show that, in UK data, girls experience a negative link between social media use and life satisfaction when they are 11-13 years old and boys when they are 14-15 years old. Increased social media use again predicts lower life satisfaction at age 19 years. At other times the link was not statistically significant.</a>
