            <span class="post-metadata">(0 min |  words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <p class="post-content">People who are physically active during childhood have higher cognitive functions in later life. Participants who exercised when they were children did better on cognitive tests regardless of their current age. However, no such relationship was found between task performance and post-childhood exercise -- suggesting that exercise during childhood is particularly important for brain development and long-term cognitive health.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Sour taste does not have the nearly universal appeal that sweet taste does. Slightly sour foods or drinks such as yogurt and lemon juice are yummy to many, but such highly sour foods as spoiled milk are yucky, even dangerous. Like humans, many other animals, including insects, prefer slightly acidic over very acidic foods.</p>

            <p class="post-content">A study found that stress, anxiety and depression during the first few weeks of the pandemic were associated with less and lower quality sleep. In a survey of more than 900 twins, about half of the respondents reported no change in sleep patterns, but 32.9 percent reported decreased sleep. Another 29.8 percent reported sleeping more. The researchers found that any change in sleep was connected to self-reported mental health issues, though more strongly associated with decreased sleep.</p>

We all, no matter our income, culture or religion are bound to die. Even if we escape mortal diseases or accidents, we all face a deadly biological deterioration. While the debate of human longevity has divided the scientific community for centuries, a new study finds fresh evidence for our inevitable death.</p>

Young adults with poor cardiovascular health who improved their cardiovascular health over time reduced their chances of heart attack, stroke or heart failure later in life. Those who maintained good cardiovascular health from a young age had the lowest risk of premature cardiovascular disease.</p>

Termed super-resolution, the imaging methodology combines positron emission tomography (PET) with an external motion tracking device to create highly detailed images of the brain.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Lab animals deficient in vitamin D crave and become dependent on opioids, which is curbed when normal levels of the vitamin are restored. Human health records indicate that people with low vitamin D are more likely to use and misuse opioids. Study results suggest a potential role for vitamin D supplementation in fighting opioid addiction.</p>

Today I’m adding the /photos section to that theme (something I’ve written about before),
and giving a little background information.
This site’s brutalist design is the result of about a decade of refinement
and tweaking. For specific goals - minimalism, optimization, adaptability,
clarity - I think it has achieved a certain balance.
I get an email about which theme I’m using every month or two. The answer is,
well, this one. I started from a blank HTML page a decade ago, and have
tried to make it better ever since. Better in a few ways:
Clean bill of health from Google Lighthouse: 100 in performance,

Real accessibility, based on real feedback from folks with reduced

The findings indicate an overlap between COVID-19 and brain changes common in Alzheimer&#x27;s, and may help inform risk management and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19-associated cognitive impairment.</p>

They report high levels of cis P-tau, a pathogenic protein, in human AD and VaD brains as well as preclinical disease models. Treatment with an antibody to the toxic protein prevented disease progression and reversed disease symptoms and restored cognitive function in older mice.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Most people listen to music throughout their day and often near bedtime to wind down. But can that actually cause your sleep to suffer? When a sleep researcher realized he was waking in the middle of the night with a song stuck in his head, he saw an opportunity to study how music -- and particularly stuck songs -- might affect sleep patterns.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Scientists have identified a novel gene, Per2AS, that controls the sleep/wake cycle in mice. Per2AS appears to be a new type of gene, known as a non-coding gene. Unlike most other genes, Per2AS is not translated from RNA into a subsequent protein, thus making its function unclear until now.</p>

They now report that one of these mucins, MUC5AC, is more closely and reliably associated with the development of COPD than is its brother, MUC5B.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Nerve cells of the vagus nerve fulfill opposing tasks. The gut and the brain communicate with each other in order to adapt satiety and blood sugar levels during food consumption. The vagus nerve is an important communicator between these two organs. Researchers now took a closer look at the functions of the different nerve cells in the control center of the vagus nerve, and discovered something very surprising: although the nerve cells are located in the same control center, they innervate different regions of the gut and also differentially control satiety and blood sugar levels. This discovery could play an important role in the development of future therapeutic strategies against obesity and diabetes.</p>

Scientists have found that the targeting the protein called FK506-binding protein 51 or FKBP51 promotes the clearing of those toxic proteins via autophagy, a natural process whereby cells recycle damaged proteins and mitochondria and use them for nutrition.</p>

waiting for furniture to arrive, and dreading the next interaction with our
absolutely-terrible-no-good moving company. When VCs and some tech company
‘disrupt’ moving by undercutting and technologizing movers, I will make
an exception and cheer them on: this industry deserves to end.
But then, seeing so many old faces, reconnecting, finding a new

            <p class="post-content">When a single gene in a cell is turned on or off, its resulting presence or absence can affect the function and survival of the cell. Researchers have now successfully catalogued this effect in the human neuron by separately toggling each of the 20,000 genes in the human genome.</p>

            <p class="post-content">Researchers at Lund University in Sweden have developed an algorithm that combines data from a simple blood test and brief memory tests, to predict with great accuracy who will develop Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the future. The findings are published in Nature Medicine.</p>

            <p class="post-content">As some of you may have read over the past days, there has been an ownership dispute over the freenode.net network. The IRC network has been used by Arch Linux and many other projects over the past decades as a platform for discussion and support.
The dispute led to the exodus of most former freenode staff from the network and the founding of a new network: libera.chat
Starting today, Arch Linux and its sister projects Arch Linux ARM and Arch Linux 32 will begin migrating the official IRC channels from freenode.net to libera.chat. Please bear with us as this can take some time to be fully settled in.
We thank the freenode community for the many years of great service and collaboration.</p>

            </summary>
            <p class="post-content">One of the first studies to examine telomere length (TL) in childhood finds that the initial setting of TL during prenatal development and in the first years of life may determine one&#x27;s TL throughout childhood and potentially even into adulthood or older age. The study also finds that TL decreases most rapidly from birth to age 3, followed by a period of maintenance into the pre-puberty period, although it was sometimes seen to lengthen.</p>
