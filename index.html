              Memory Dump Collection using Procdump.exe for App Service (Windows)
              <span class="post-metadata">(29 min | 8717 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/memory-dump-collection-using-procdump-exe-for-app-service/ba-p/4185635>A memory dump is a snapshot of the contents of a computer&#x27;s volatile memory (RAM) stored for analysis or debugging purposes.¬† ProcDump is a command-line tool designed to monitor applications for CPU/Memory spikes and generate crash dumps when spikes occur. Administrators or developers can then use these dumps to pinpoint the cause of the spikes. This guide will walk you through collecting a memory dump using Procdump.exe for applications hosted on App Service (Windows).
¬†

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Click on &quot;Advanced Tools&quot; and then &quot;Go -&gt;&quot; to access the SCM/Kudu site.


¬†

On the SCM site, go to Process Explorer to find the PID of the w3wp.exe process, which is the application worker process.


¬†

Use the Debug console to open the CMD option.


¬†

Navigate to the System Drive and access the sysinternals path:

C:\devtools\sysinternals&gt;
Note: The drive letter may vary (e.g., D:\ or C:)



¬†

Locate the procdump.exe file in the sysinternals directory, which will be used for running commands.
To collect logs for the application worker process, use the PID obtained earlier.
Use the following command to collect a full memory dump.

Procdump.exe -accepteula -ma [PID] [Path]

Path:¬†Specifies the directory where the collected memory dump file will be stored.


Example: procdump.exe -accepteula -ma 5100 C:\dumps\



¬†

Initiate the dump collection and reproduce the issue the application is facing.


¬†

After the memory dump collection is complete, access the specific path on the SCM site to download the collected memory dump.



¬†
You can consult the following article for further details on Procdump commands and various parameters to utilize depending on your specific needs and troubleshooting scenario.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump
¬†
It&#x27;s advisable to gather multiple sets of memory dumps because analyzing several dumps can reveal patterns and facilitate the development of an action plan to resolve issues effectively.</a>

¬†

Choose &quot;Collect .NET Profiler Trace&quot; option.
Configure the trace options to gather data from the specific application instance, including thread details.


¬†

Reproduce the issue at step 2.


¬†

Access and examine the generated report.


¬†

In the demo application, a delay of approximately 20 seconds was observed. Refer to the browser network traces provided below.


¬†

Analyze the profiler traces to pinpoint the cause of the reported delay.


¬†

After examining the demo app&#x27;s code, it was evident that a deliberate 20-second delay was introduced in the Privacy method within the Home Controller.


¬†

Note: Default profiler log collection time is 60 seconds and it is possible to increase the default profiling duration by setting an application setting IIS_PROFILING_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS with a maximum value of 900 (i.e. 15 minutes).</a>

ACR has passed the OCI conformance test and is now certified by the OCI community as an OCI-v1.1 compliant registry. The test report is available on the OCI-Conformant Products page.

There are many reasons for this symptom, such as connection errors with the storage account, runtime being down, indexing failure, and the synctriggers failure that we&#x27;ll discuss.
¬†
To confirm whether your issue is indeed due to synctriggers, you could press F12 in your browser to activate developer mode and search for the keyword &quot;batch&quot; under the &quot;Network&quot; tab. This endpoint is used by the Azure portal to call various internal services of the Function App (e.g., retrieving app settings, site information, getting host status, etc.), including synctriggers.

Until now, you could only view the load test results on the Azure portal, which required internet access and RBAC permissions. Now, you can download the report as an HTML file and share it with your stakeholders or teammates offline.

You don&#x27;t want to be outpaced by competitors or newer technologies, and you want to be able to quickly iterate on your ideas or pivot to new ones. This is where LangChain.js comes in. It&#x27;s a framework that allows you to build AI applications very little adherence to the underlying AI technologies and tools. It abstracts some of the complexity of AI development, allowing you to focus on the business ‚Ä¶</a>

Consider a connected car platform that processes data from millions of cars. Or a national retailer running pop-up campaign that processes pre-orders. Or a healthcare provider calculating big data analytics. All of these can have variable load requirements ‚Äî from zero to tens of thousands of requests per second (RPS). The serverless model has grown rapidly as developers increasingly run event-triggered code as a service, pushing platform limits, and Azure Functions customers now want to orchestrate complex serverless solutions and expect high throughput.

This feedback led us to revamp the Azure Functions platform architecture to help ensure that it meets our customers‚Äô most demanding performance requirements. As this article des‚Ä¶</a>
