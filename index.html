              Introducing Azure App Spaces: Getting your code into the cloud as fast as possible
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9684 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/introducing-azure-app-spaces-getting-your-code-into-the-cloud-as/ba-p/3827951>We are excited to announce Azure App Spaces (preview), one of the fastest and easiest way to deploy and manage your web apps on Azure. Azure App Spaces is a portal-based experience that takes an app-first approach to building, deploying, and running your apps. App Spaces makes it easier for developers to get started using Azure, without needing to be an expert on the hundreds of different cloud services. 
 
Detect the right Azure services from your repository
 

 
App Spaces lets you connect your GitHub repositories to Azure, and through analysis of the code inside your GitHub repository, suggests the correct Azure services you should use. Once you deploy, GitHub Actions is used to create a continuous deployment pipeline between your repositories and your newly provisioned cloud services. Once you&#x27;ve deployed your app via App Spaces, changes to your code will immediately be pushed to your connected Azure services. 
 
Bring your own repository or start from a template
 

 
App Spaces also provides sample templates, powered by Azure Developer CLI, that provide a helpful blueprint for getting started with Azure. You can use these templates to immediately create a GitHub repository, connect it to Azure, and provision a distinct set of services for the template scenario. Our templates include sample static websites, web apps, and APIs, in a variety of different languages.
 
Manage your app in a consolidated view
 

 
 
In addition to making it easier and faster to get started developing, App Spaces also provides a simplified, app-centric management experience. An &quot;App Space&quot; is a loose collection of cloud services that, collectively, comprise the app you are building. You can manage your compute, database, caching, and other key services all within the same, easy-to-use management experience.
 
To get started immediately, you can check out App Spaces here. You can also read our documentation to get a better look at what App Spaces can do for you.</a>

Cloud-native development is a paradigm that aims to deliver scalable, resilient, and adaptable applications that can run on any cloud platform. Microsoft&#x27;s cloud-native products, such as Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Functions, and Azure DevOps, provide the tools and services to help developers build, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications with ease. We have seen this transformation take form in the way Zooniverse adopted Azure in order to become more efficient when updating their people-powered research platform and using the grant funding they run on. PosAm is able to help users find parking spaces faster, while also decreasing carbon emissions of vehicles as a result.

An alternative hosting option for runtime services
Prior to today&#x27;s announcement user&#x27;s options for runtime services was a choice between Azure managed services (such as Azure Cache for Redis), or self-hosting the service as an ACA app (typically using an open-source version). Now there&#x27;s another option through add-ons. Add-ons are Microsoft curated containers that are intended for development use where the full enterprise-grade quality of Azure managed services is not needed.

That’s why we so often spend so much effort to optimize the time between “File Save” and “Browser Reload”. A lot of time this loop happens entirely on our workstations, and we forgo the true end-to-end test of reviewing our changes on the platform that will later run the application -- doing so usually takes too long.
 
This gap between developing and running an application is often also the reason we rarely keep our applications up to date. Once an app is running and we’ve moved on to the next project, it’s often too tedious to come back. We need to switch context, reopen an old project we barely remember, just to check if there’s been an update to any of the components we’ve used. If t…</a>

Cloud-native apps are often composed of distributed microservices hosted in containers for solutions that are loosely coupled, resilient, manageable, and observable as defined by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Event-driven applications are designed to respond to events that occur in real-time or near real-time. Events can be triggered by various sources such as user interactions, system events, sensor data, or other applications.

Customers benefit from Azure Load Testing (ALT) because the service abstracts away the environment setup and teardown, needed for high scale loads; and simplifies the analysis of the test results through the built in test criteria and integrated results dashboard. In this blogpost, we will demonstrate how you can gain more benefit from the automation and customization options provided by the service. If you haven’t used the service yet, you can get started and run your first load test in less than 10 minutes.

              Git migration completed

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/git-migration-completed/>We are proud to announce that the migration to Git packaging succeeded! 🥳
Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!
Package sources are now available on GitLab. Note that the bugtracker is still flyspray and that merge requests are not accepted as of now. 
We intend to open the issue tracker and merge requests on the Gitlab package repos in the near future.
Mirrors are syncing again, but it may take a bit of time until your mirror of choice has caught up.
For users
Update your system and merge the pacman pacnew /etc/pacman.conf.pacnew file. This is required as we have moved the [community] repository into [extra].
$ pacman -Syu &quot;pacman&gt;&#x3D;6.0.2-7&quot;

For users of the now deprecated asp tool, you will need to switch to pkgctl:
$ pacman -Syu &quot;devtools&gt;&#x3D;1:1.0.0-1&quot;
$ pkgctl repo clone linux

For some more detailed instructions on how to obtain PKGBUILDs see the corresponding wiki article.
For packagers
Before starting, first uninstall devtools-git-poc and remove any repos from your filesystem that you cloned during the git proof-of-concept testing.
Make sure you have both, an updated devtools and pacman on your system:
$ pacman -Syu &quot;devtools&gt;&#x3D;1:1.0.0-1&quot; &quot;pacman&gt;&#x3D;6.0.2-7&quot;

Additionally clean up old chroots in /var/lib/archbuild/
$ rm -rf /var/lib/archbuild/
# or optionally, use the --clean option for pkgctl build *ONCE*
$ pkgctl build --clean

For instruction on how to use pkgctl, please take a look at the &quot;How to be a packager&quot; wiki article and also consult the man page of each subcommand for further information:
$ man pkgctl-build
$ man pkgctl-repo-clone</a>

As with every article in this series this has been driven by customer use cases. In this instance the customer desired having a development web application on a public domain but ring fenced to only allow access to authenticated users from Azure AD.
 
Before we dive deeper into the use case and implementation its important to understand the various components if unfamiliar. I will speak about benefits of certain technologies as I go through but it is worth taking a quick look at these links as a level set if you need it:

I have decided to create a series of blogs covering some of the common ways to increase cluster security. I have plans for blog posts regarding Azure AD user authentication on micro services, utilizing Open Service Mesh and Network Policies to implement internal cluster networking security and the different options regarding metrics, alerting and telemetry for AKS clusters.
 
Today however I will start by discussing using Azure Front Door, Private Link Service and NGINX Ingress Controller to create a secure ingress to private back end services with SSL termination.

              Git migration announcement

            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/git-migration-announcement/>This Friday morning (2023-05-19) the Git packaging migration will start until Sunday (2023-05-21). The Arch Linux packaging team will not be able to update packages in any of the repositories during this period.
Notification when the migration starts, and when it is completed, will be published on the [arch-dev-public] mailing list.
How does this impact Arch Linux users?
The [testing] repository will be split into [core-testing] and [extra-testing], the [staging] repository will be split into [core-staging] and [extra-staging]. The [community] repository will be merged into [extra] and will therefore be empty after the migration.
All affected repositories will be provided as empty repositories for a transition period after the migration. For regular users, this means that everything works as before.
Note: After the migration is done, users that have the testing repositories enabled need to include the new repositories ([core-testing] and [extra-testing] instead of [testing]) in their pacman.conf before updating their system.
Other changes:
SVN access is discontinued and will dissappear.
The svn2git mirror will no longer be updated.
asp, which relies on the svn2git mirror, will stop working. It is replaced by pkgctl repo clone.
How does this impact Arch Linux tier 1 mirrors?
During the migration rsync and HTTP access will be shut down. We will send an email notification to arch-mirrors once everything has been finished.
How does this impact Arch Linux packagers?
Packagers will not be able to patch and update their packages. The internal Tier 0 mirror is also going to be disabled for the duration of this migration.</a>

Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to walk through how we migrate our existing ASP.NET application to the Azure App Service instance with minimal code changes.
 
What needs to consider for changes?
 
I&#x27;m more than confident to migrate our existing ASP.NET application to Azure App Service with no changes because that&#x27;s what Azure App Service is designed for. However, there are a few things to change due to the cloud-native characteristics of Azure App Service. Then, what are they?

Customers may want to list all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoints, and enable Network Security Group for the Private Endpoints.
There is no way to do it from Azure portal. But the below Power shell script can help customers list all the subnets used for Private Endpoints.
 

List all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoint using PowerShell script

$privateEndpoints &#x3D; Get-AzPrivateEndpoint
$subnetIds &#x3D; $privateEndpoints | ForEach-Object { $_.Subnet.Id }
$uniqueSubnetIds &#x3D; $subnetIds | Sort-Object -Unique
 
foreach ($subnetId in $uniqueSubnetIds) {
    Get-AzResource -ResourceId $subnetId
}
 
The output is like this 

 

Regarding more parameters for Get-AzPrivateEndpoint

         Check Get-AzPrivateEndpoint (Az.Network) | Microsoft Learn
 

How To Enable Network Security Group for Private Endpoints 
By default, network policies are disabled for a subnet in a virtual network.
You need to assign the NSG name first in this subnet, then enable NSG in “Network Policy for Private Endpoint”, then the PE will be applied the NSG rule.

For this, we will be using Microsoft Azure App Service, a PaaS (platform as a service) offering by Microsoft Azure, because it&#x27;s quite suitable for long running applications and web workloads.
 
As we want our application to be fully-managed and scaling automatically in the cloud, MongoDB Atlas is a great choice for our data store since it’s a fully-managed, cloud-native database as a service that can also scale up and down automatically in a cost-effective way to meet the needs of any application.

By default, Azure Spring App uses Azure DNS for name resolution. However, in some cases, you may want to use custom DNS servers for name resolution. This article explains how to configure custom DNS for Azure Spring App in a private network.
 
Suggestions for Using Custom DNS.


Set up less than 3 custom DNS servers. 


         Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses the CoreDNS project for cluster DNS management and resolution. Based on observation, it only takes the first three custom DNS server settings. If you specify more than three custom DNS servers, AKS will only use the first three. 
         


Make sure that all custom DNS servers have same records that all of them could resolv…</a>

Having the ability to identify clear root cause for incidents in production workloads is valuable, the best way to prevent future incidents is to understand what caused past ones. Of course you can have a good set of load tests but still, incidents in production environments can happen and it&#x27;s crucial to have available data that can help to understand what happened so application can be improved and prevent replications.
In this article we will learn how to use Application Insights and automatic profiler to find root cause for past incidents and prepare logging platform to ensure meaningful data for analysis.

It finally came to the new protocol HTTP/2 announced by IETF in 2015, which is a more modernized, faster and more secure version, almost all major web browsers are on board so far.
As one of the powerful app platform providers, App service team also announced the support for the HTTP/2 protocol  for all apps hosted on App Service in March 2018.
 
What are the key differences from HTTP/1.x on app service?
 

HTTP/2 is binary
Fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
Ability to use one connection for parallelism
Has one TCP/IP connection per origin
Uses header compression to reduce overh…</a>
