When it comes to website security, one important step is to add a custom domain and connect it with a TLS/SSL certificate. This not only enhances the trust and safety of your website but also ensures that your visitors&#x27; information is encrypted and protected.¬†Azure App Service provides TLS bindings for the most common custom domains. This blog discusses the special domain and certificate binding situations in Azure App Service for IDN hostnames.

What is an IDN hostname?
An IDN hostname is a domain name that includes characters used in the local representation of languages not written with the basic Latin alphabet &quot;a-z&quot;. These characters can be Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Cyrillic, Tamil, Hindi, and more.
The internet is primarily based on ASCII, which does not support these characte‚Ä¶</a>

Organisations are increasingly understanding the value that machine learning and artificial intelligence can deliver across all industries. Subsequently those organisations are also evaluating how to move machine learning projects from experimental stages to production. This surge in AI/ML interest also comes at a time when businesses are prioritising cost optimization of new and existing technology projects.

Frequently customers I am speaking too are asking how they can deploy reliable, robust and¬†cost effective deployment platforms for moving machine learning models into production.

Committing to the savings plan allows you to get savings, up to the hourly commitment amount, on the resources you use.¬†You can choose to pay all at once or monthly. The best part? Turning on the Savings Plan will not mess with your current set-ups or apps. You just get the savings while everything runs as usual. If you are running big apps, this plan can optimize your investments. It brings down your overall costs for using Azure Spring Apps Enterprise.¬†

Say goodbye to the complexities of JMeter scripting with our new feature which allows you to create load tests directly by providing your HTTP requests. No prior expertise in testing tools is required ‚Äì just navigate to the portal, input your HTTP requests, and you&#x27;re all set! 
With this new experience you can specify the endpoint, HTTP method, headers, query parameters, or just enter cURL commands effortlessly. But that&#x27;s not all you also have additional functionalities with this.

Extract data from the response of one request and pass it on to a subsequent request. For example, if you are retrieving an authentication token in a request and would like to use it for authentication in your subsequent requests, you can store it in a variable and do so.

We have partnered with Brave Search to bring their search results into Kagi. Brave joins the growing list of Kagi&#x27;s search sources, ensuring that if you can not find something on Kagi, it does not exist on the web. This will come at no additional cost to you, thanks to continuous optimizations in our search stack.



Kagi Assistant usage stats are now on the stats page. Assistant is still in beta and currently available to Ultimate plan users. We plan to roll it out to all members in January.  #2141 @Grooty



We vastly improved Image search results. Check them here including all the powerful filters.

homeownership rings stronger - who grew up in instability or in countries where
physical goods are preferred to financial instruments for savings.
I don‚Äôt want to buy a house. Maybe I‚Äôll need to, but I can‚Äôt help but think that
the milestone is vastly overrated in public imagination and there are problems
with it on a personal and societal level.
