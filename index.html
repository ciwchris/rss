              Dockershim deprecation and AKS

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/dockershim-deprecation-and-aks/ba-p/3055902>The huge success of Docker in energizing the tech community around containers has been truly amazing to see.¬† As containers are the foundation of Kubernetes, it goes hand in hand that Docker was a core part of the platform. As Kubernetes matured, and the needs of the community and our customers grew, the tight coupling of Docker to Kubernetes through dockershim (the interface between the Kubernetes platform and the Docker runtime) needed to evolve. On 2 December 2020, with the release of Kubernetes 1.20, Kubernetes announced it is deprecating Docker as a container runtime, through the use of dockershim, in a future release of Kubernetes.
¬†
With the upcoming Kubernetes 1.24 release, dockershim will be removed.
¬†
If you are using a supported Kubernetes version in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

For Linux node pools, there is no action required on your part. All supported Kubernetes versions on AKS use containerd as the default runtime for Kubernetes 1.19 and greater.
For Windows Server 2019 node pools, in January 2021, we announced the general availability of containerd as the default container runtime for Kubernetes 1.23 and greater. If you are using a cluster with a Kubernetes version prior to 1.23, you can create a new node pool with containerd enabled before the switch over to it being the default in 1.23 then move your pods to the new pool.

¬†
We work very closely with the community through our participation in the Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIG) from Storage, to Windows and everything in between and I&#x27;d like to thank both the community and our engineering teams for the work to get to this milestone.</a>

¬†
In our¬†previous article¬†we explored how to deploy Grafana and Prometheus on AKS. However, despite Prometheus being an excellent way to monitor your AKS cluster, it lacks some functionality to save metrics for future use and enable us to query historical data.
¬†
Prometheus is a metrics collector, it can be used to collect metrics from any source, and it can be used to generate graphs. However, it is not a data storage solution and therefore isn&#x27;t not focused on storing data for historical purposes. Prometheus has its storage solution and supports both on-disk storage as well as remote locations. You can configure a lot of options but the data management options are limited. This is where Thanos can help.

With this feature, you&#x27;ll be able to migrate your existing ASE as well as the apps running on that ASE to ASEv3. ASEv3 provides a number of feature differences¬†as well as performance enhancements and potential reduced overall costs¬†compared to previous versions. To get a complete overview on ASEv3, read the ASEv3 focused App Service Environment overview.

Check out the following docs to learn more about migrating to ASEv3:

- Migrate to App Service Environment v3
- How to Migrate to ASEv3

Please note, at this time, the public preview supports a subset of possible ASE configurations. Be sure to review the supported scenarios to see if you can migrate at this time using the feature and stay tuned for updates as we release additional capabilities.

An Azure portal experience for migration will be available at the start of February, 2022. Be on the lookout for additional announcements.

If your ASE isn&#x27;t supported for migration¬†using the migration feature and your ASE isn&#x27;t listed under one of the upcoming supported scenarios, you have the option to migrate to ASEv3 manually. See the migration alternatives¬†for more details.</a>

Researchers from DZNE and the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) come to this conclusion based on a study of more than 1,000 older adults. To this end, various proteins were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid: They served as so-called biomarkers that indicate inflammatory processes of the nervous system. As it turned out, some of these molecules seem to be part of a damage control program of the immune system, which could be useful for the development of new drugs.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/01/220112094014.htm>With nearly 10% of the world&#x27;s population affected, type 2 diabetes is a major public health issue. An excessively sedentary lifestyle and a too-caloric diet encourage the development of this metabolic disease by altering the functioning of pancreatic cells and making blood sugar regulation less effective. However, fat, which is often cited as the ideal culprit, could be rehabilitated. Indeed, fat does not necessarily aggravate the disease and could even play a protective role: by studying insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, scientists have shown that these cells suffered less from excess sugar when they had previously been exposed to fat.</a>

              A semblance of understanding
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 334 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/01/10/semblance-of-understanding.html>Six years later, I‚Äôm still taking a lot of notes in notebooks. I‚Äôve bought many editions of Field Notes, which I still love. And emptied many Muji pens on the page.
But I have to admit: I‚Äôve only reopened my archived notebooks a handful of times. Once or twice to retrieve contemporaneous notes about business events, and a few times to refresh my memory of the early part of a book while writing a review. So what are notes for?
Part of the Field Notes motto is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not writing it down to remember it later, I‚Äôm writing it down to remember it now.‚Äù That captures part of it, but memory isn‚Äôt the only lens to think about note-taking.
A common thread here is semblance. Note-taking is about building a semblance of understanding, in the same way that exercise can be about creating a semblance of control.

I‚Äôve dissed ‚Äúknowledge graphs‚Äù ad-nauseum ‚Äì¬†that by virtue of never labeling the edges they never capture real relationship between items and make vague thinking easy, that none of their implementers roll up their sleeves and implement better graph layout so they‚Äôre readable and instead use d3‚Äôs force directed graph or graphviz, that they just never really become useful.
But whatever: is it really about using the graph, or is it about looking at it?
You can feel like you understand something without knowing anything about it, and you can understand something without feeling like you do. Both are problematic. Creating notes and other symbols of knowledge is a way to affect that balance.
Maybe the real metacognition isn‚Äôt about having a mirror image of your brain encoded in a computer, but just having a mirror. Having a nice birch box filled with notebooks or a nice dense graph that symbolizes all the things you‚Äôve noted, so that you can learn and forget comfortably. The world will always be too big to understand, but my box of notebooks, that I know.</a>

Researchers looked at whether interventions such as aerobic and strength or resistance training, had helped participants with asthma. Although they found that these interventions worked, patients with asthma may have had difficulty undertaking them because of their difficulty traveling to fitness groups or because the interventions were not suitable for people with additional health conditions. But the team say that digital interventions -- such as video appointments, smartwatches and mobile apps -- could remove some of these barriers and enable patients to carry out home-based programs in future.</a>

Considering the distributed nature of microservices, you need to account for failures, retries, and timeouts in a system composed of microservices. While Container Apps features the building blocks for running microservices, use of Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) provides an even richer microservices programming model.

Azure Container Apps offers a fully managed version of the Dapr APIs when building microservices. When you use Dapr in Azure Container Apps, you can enable sidecars to run next to your microservices that provide a rich set of capabilities.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/01/02/recently.html>I wrote a little yearly round-up over on Placemark.
I‚Äôm not one for concrete resolutions or nostalgia, so on with the usual, a Recently.
Reading
I read Policing the Open Road
on Rebecca‚Äôs suggestion. It‚Äôs an incredible book that I‚Äôll
probably re-read soon, because the central conflict that it sets out feels so thoroughly
deadlocked, unresolvable, and important - the interplay between privacy, safety, police
power, and freedom.
I don‚Äôt agree with all of it, but Jon McLoone‚Äôs explanatio of why Wolfram is not open source
resonated strongly with me. Placemark, as I‚Äôve said before, is not planning on being
open source, though components of the application will be released. Some of my reasoning
lines up with Wolfram‚Äôs pretty precisely. The central piece for me, I think, is just
what the community means - where communities come from, how they agree on what they
do, how they collect and disperse. Magical thinking around what constitutes
community and how it operates is my biggest gripe about open source ideology in this
day and age: too many people happily ignore the top-heaviness of some communities,
or don‚Äôt think about where the direction, leadership, contributions, and standards
come from.
Watching

Watch Vampire‚Äôs Kiss. That is all.
Expect to see in the new year: more, probably shorter, blog posts. More photos.
And Placemark, out in the wild.</a>

This has been fixed in 2.9.12-6, so the upgrade may need to overwrite any untracked pyc files created. If you get errors like these

when updating, use
pacman -Syu --overwrite /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/\*
