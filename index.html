and they can‚Äôt, or they‚Äôve bought a house. The desire to own ones own home is
almost universal in the people I know in the US. It‚Äôs even stronger for folks
who live outside of major cities. And people for whom the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù part of
homeownership rings stronger - who grew up in instability or in countries where
physical goods are preferred to financial instruments for savings.
I don‚Äôt want to buy a house. Maybe I‚Äôll need to, but I can‚Äôt help but think that
the milestone is vastly overrated in public imagination and there are problems
with it on a personal and societal level.

Houses are non-diversified, illiquid holdings that make up too large a
percentage of people‚Äôs total invested assets.

¬†
Durable Functions (DF) enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the¬†Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code.¬†
¬†
There are two major changes introduced in this release: upgrading to the latest version of the Azure Storage SDK (a breaking change for .NET in-process apps) and the introduction of a new partition manager. We describe these and the motivation for each in the sections below.¬†
¬†
Please note:¬†

At this time, DF extension v3.0.0-rc.1 is only supported in the App Service Plan. Auto-scaling support for the Consumption and Elastic Premium plans will be announced later.¬†
Durable Functions v3 does not support Azure Functions runtime V1.¬†¬†‚Ä¶</a>

This announcement introduced new rendering modes and interactivity, allowing more flexibility to choose the right rendering mode for your Blazor web apps. In this article, we‚Äôll take a closer look at standalone Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) projects, their considerations relative to other Blazor rendering modes, and how we can build full-stack .NET 8 serverless apps on Azure Static Web Apps with Blazor WASM and Functions APIs.

In .NET 8, Blazor has introduced a unified full-stack model, the Blazor Web App. This model enables you to opt for any of the various supported rendering modes (client rendering, server-side rende‚Ä¶</a>

Azure Container Apps is a great platform for running polyglot apps and containers of all kinds in Azure, as it abstracts away the complexity of managing underlying Kubernetes while providing unified networking, observability, and scaling for higher developer velocity. While it serves as a versatile container platform, it may not offer precise insights into your Java applications or the state of your Java execution environment (such as the JVM). To better cater to our Java-centric customers running containerized apps, we&#x27;ve recently initiated a new journey to enhance the Java developer experience on Azure Container Apps.

              Bugtracker migration to GitLab completed
              <span class="post-metadata">(1 min | 293 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/bugtracker-migration-to-gitlab-completed/>We are happy to announce that the migration of the bugtracker to GitLab is done! ü•≥ 
Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!
This means the issue tracker and merge requests on the GitLab package repos are now enabled.
The old bugtracker will subsequently be closed down. For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked Task #56716) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.
Packaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the &quot;Add a new Bug&quot; button on the package page on archlinux.org will automatically direct you to the correct place to open the issue. The workflow afterwards is mostly the same, first our Bug Wranglers will have a look at the issues and triage them, and then they will be handed over to the respective Package Maintainers to fix. A list of all issues can be found here.
If you do not have an account for GitLab already (which authenticates against our SSO service), please write us a mail with your desired username to accountsupport@archlinux.org as advised in the banner.</a>

I love shopping! I do. I love commerce‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe dance of it, the etiquette. I love it as buyer and seller both. I love considering alternatives, and I love being considered. I love settling on favorites. I love stumbling across surprises.
Am I simply bourgeois? Yes, and I‚Äôll wave that flag proudly. This is a big part of my politics: which is not a politics of ‚Äúfree markets‚Äù or ‚Äúfree trade‚Äù, but rather of systems that can support commerce and craft at every level, especially the smallest and most careful.
