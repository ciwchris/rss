This method enhances security by avoiding the need to store credentials in code or configuration files. If you are interested in connecting to an Azure SQL database from a Python Function App using managed identity, you can find a related post here.
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets, keys, and certificates. With managed identities for Azure resources, you can authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication without needing credentials in your code.
Let&#x27;s dive into the steps to achieve this with a Python App Service.

Getting a certificate free of your cost for your apps without having to worry about the management of the certificate‚Äôs life cycle has now become a standard that customers expect from services. This has now been used by many customers on both their test and production environment because not only does it help them save on costs, but it also helps them save on the headaches of having to manage certificates.

We are very excited to share with you the launch of Managed Certs on ACA to GA!

              Command Override in Azure Container Apps /Container App Job
              <span class="post-metadata">(34 min | 10137 words)</span> 
            </summary>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/command-override-in-azure-container-apps-container-app-job/ba-p/4082514>Introduction
Azure Container Apps (ACA) provides a flexible and scalable platform for deploying containerized applications. One powerful feature it offers is the ability to customize startup commands and override default CMD or ENTRYPOINT defined in a Dockerfile. In this blog, we&#x27;ll explore how to leverage the &quot;Command Override&quot; option using various methods in ACA and Container App Jobs.
¬†
Understanding Command Overrides
Command overrides come in handy when you need to execute specific CMD or change the ENTRYPOINT of your container at runtime.
¬†
Example:
If one wants to run &quot;index.js&quot; during the start of the app, but as per line number 14 in below image, the &quot;server.js&quot; file will execute.

JavaScript, the powerhouse behind many applications, sometimes faces limitations when it comes to memory in a Node.js environment.¬† Today, let&#x27;s dive into a common challenge faced by many applications - the default memory limit in Node.js.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/mkinitcpio-hook-migration-and-early-microcode/>With the release of mkinitcpio v38, several hooks previously provided by Arch packages have been
moved to the mkinitcpio upstream project. The hooks are: systemd, udev, encrypt,
sd-encrypt, lvm2 and mdadm_udev.
To ensure no breakage of users&#x27; setup occurs, temporary
conflicts have been introduced into the respective packages to prevent installing packages
that are no longer compatible.
The following packages needs to be upgraded together:
mkinitcpio 38-3
systemd 255.4-2
lvm2 2.03.23-3
mdadm 4.3-2
cryptsetup 2.7.0-3
Please note that the mkinitcpio flag --microcode, and the microcode option in the preset files,  has been deprecated in favour of
a new microcode hook. This also allows you to drop the microcode initrd
lines from your boot configuration as they are now packed together with the main initramfs image.</a>

This process brings simplicity, consistency, and a better mechanism to govern IT policies when deploying Java apps to the cloud. We‚Äôre now enhancing the build process with two new features: Tomcat and build environment variable support.

Tomcat is one of the most popular and widely used Java web servers, providing a fast and reliable platform for running Java applications on the web. By supporting Tomcat in the cloud build process, we make it easy for developers to migrate their existing Java web applications to Azure Container Apps without changing any code or configuration.

By default, HTTP apps in Azure Container Apps are accessible via a public URL that is unique to the app. However, you can create a container app to use a reverse proxy like NGINX to control how traffic is routed to multiple apps based on the path or hostname.

In this tutorial, you&#x27;ll learn how to use Azure Container Apps to configure path and hostname-based routing for a set of containerized applications using NGINX as a reverse proxy.

Backstage, originally created by a small team during a hack week, is now a CNCF Incubation project. An incubation project means that it is considered stable and successfully being used in production, at scale by enterprises. Backstage is a platform for building developer portals which act as an operational platform between developers and the services they need to deploy. Developer portals can accelerate developer velocity providing push button deployment of production ready services and infrastructure.

In this Walkthrough we will learn about what Backstage is as well as how we can build and deploy it on Azure using multiple services including:

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker that allows you to connect, decouple, and exchange messages between different applications and services. It supports a range of communication patterns, such as queues, topics, and event hubs, and enables reliable and secure message delivery at scale.
However, to ensure that your Azure Service Bus solution can handle the expected load and performance requirements, you need to conduct load testing and measure the throughput, latency, and resource utilization of your system under various scenarios. Load testing can help you identify and resolve any bottlenecks, errors, or failures that might occur when your system is under stress.

Import public content locally whenever possible
Importing public content to an internal registry is the first step in a set of best practices for your software supply chain .

¬†

How do you manage the lifecycle of those APIs?
What governance would you apply to these APIs?
What is the list of environments needed to manage these APIs?
What are the deployment strategies for those APIs?
How would you integrate those APIs with other services?

¬†
As your company&#x27;s number of APIs increases, so does the complexity of managing them. Azure API Center (APIC) is a central repository for your APIs lifecycle management, and it offers the more efficient ways for management. Throughout this post, I will take a first look at what Azure API Center is and what it offers.

You can find a sample code from this GitHub repository.

Kagi Bangs repository is now open source (thanks @Browsing6853 for suggesting this in #481). You can now refine the accuracy of existing bangs or introduce new ones for everyone to enjoy on Kagi Search. Your contributions will enhance the search experience for users worldwide.



Fresh from Kagi Labs: We&#x27;re shipping an alpha version of Kagi Sidekick, a search and &quot;chat with content&quot; solution for websites.
 

  
Kagi Sidekick will offer instant site search results, and on-demand AI generated summaries, by tapping directly into the website&#x27;s content. As a bonus, the website content will automatically (after opt-in) surface as a part of Kagi search index.
You can see Sidekick live in action in Kagi&#x27;s documentation.
