It provides bi-directional streaming. gRPC services can be defined using protocol buffers, a powerful binary serialization toolset, and language, and provides tools for generating clients and servers across different languages. Now you can deploy Spring apps with gRPC support in Azure Spring Apps.

Once secrets are defined at the application level, secured values are available to revisions in your container apps. Additionally, you can reference secured values inside scale rules.

This blog provides a detailed, step-by-step procedure for removing secrets associated with an Azure Container Registry (ACR). In this example, we will walk through the process of creating a Container App with an image reference from the ACR, which automatically generates a secret. We will then attempt to remove this secret and observe its behaviour throughout the process.

Secrets are scoped to an application, outside of any specific revision of an application.

Before you stream logs in real-time, enable the log type that you want. Any information written to the console output or files ending in .txt, .log, or .htm that are stored in the /home/LogFiles directory (D:\home\LogFiles) is streamed by App Service.
¬†
Note: Some types of logging buffer write to the log file, which can result in out of order events in the stream. For example, an application log entry that occurs when a user visits a page may be displayed in the stream before the corresponding HTTP log entry for the page request.
¬†
In Azure portal
To stream logs in the Azure portal, navigate to your app and select Log Stream.
¬†
Troubleshooting StepsCheck Access to the kudu site.

The Log Stream fetches the data from kudu site, and it is important to have access to the kudu site.‚Ä¶</a>

If you&#x27;re running distributed applications on JBoss EAP, you know that clustering is essential for data consistency and fault tolerance. We&#x27;ve taken this a step further on Azure App Service. Now, when you integrate JBoss EAP with an Azure Virtual Network (VNet), clustering isn&#x27;t just an option; it&#x27;s a built-in feature that kicks in automatically.¬†
¬†
What does this mean for your apps? For starters, it improves fault tolerance and enables more efficient data sharing across multiple instances. Your application can now handle traffic spikes and server failures better. The service scales based on your configured settings in Azure App Service, providing both vertical and horizontal options.¬†

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220429145059.htm>Scientists pinpoint the molecular epicenter of deep-sleep regulation. The findings, based on research in mice, identify a gene that makes a protein that regulates delta waves -- electrical signals between neurons that occur during the deepest phases of relaxation and are a hallmark of restorative sleep.</a>
