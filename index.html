If you are looking for how to implement it in Windows App Service, you may refer to this post: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-connect-azure-sql-database-from-azure-app-service-windows/ba-p/2873397.
Note that¬†Azure Active Directory managed identity authentication method was added in ODBC Driver since version 17.3.1.1 for both system-assigned and user-assigned identities. In Azure blessed image for Python Function, the ODBC Driver version is 17.8. Which makes it possible to leverage this feature in Linux App Service.

Briefly, this post will provide you a step to step guidance with sample code and introduction on the authentication‚Ä¶</a>

Implementing secure communications as part of your solution architecture can be challenging. Many customers manually rotate their certificates or create their own solutions to automate provisioning and configuration. Even then, there is still data exfiltration risk ‚Äì say unauthorized copying or transfer of data from server systems. With Azure Spring Cloud, all of this is handled ‚Ä¶</a>

A new study finds that a simple, self-administered test can identify the early, subtle signs of dementia sooner than the most commonly used office-based standard cognitive test.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/12/211206220043.htm>Scientists in recent years have developed ways to measure biological age by tracking chemical changes in DNA that occur naturally as people age but occur at different times in different people. These so-called &#x27;epigenetic clocks&#x27; have proved to be better predictors of lifespan and health than chronological age. In a new study, Yale researchers used one such clock, appropriately named &quot;GrimAge,&quot; to ask two questions: How much does chronic stress accelerate that biological clock? And are there ways to slow it down and extend a healthy lifespan?</a>

The idea of freely sharing creative works, to be recombined by a community, was exhilarating: I would contribute raw materials to the collective - photographs, code, writing - and recombine the works of others, in Photoshop competitions or remixes. Practically every photo I‚Äôd license as CC-BY-SA. If someone used one of my photos in their blog, I felt a little jolt of approval and recognition. It felt cool.
The same went for open source. The early communities around Drupal and Node.js were radically open source. Companies were releasing their entire products for free and writing detailed blog posts about how they figured out hard problems. Whatever trade secrets they had wer‚Ä¶</a>

GitHub Actions is also suitable for building CI/CD pipelines. But, compared to Azure DevOps, there are many spaces to achieve the same efficiency level as Azure DevOps. GitHub Actions has recently released a new feature called &quot;Reusable Workflows&quot;, which you can reduce the refactoring concerns. Throughout this post, I&#x27;m going to refactor the existing Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD pipeline workflows, using the &quot;reusable workflows&quot; feature of GitHub Actions.

Workflow for Azure Static Web Apps

While provisioning an Azure Static Web Apps (ASWA) instance, GitHub Actions workflow is automatically generated by default. Here&#x27;s a sample workflow. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not that different from yours.

¬†
In this first report, you will learn about:
¬†

Platforms targeted for Spring Boot app deployments
Challenges with Spring Boot app migration to the cloud
Top monitoring tools and Spring Cloud components used today.

¬†
We plan to make this an annual survey that serves as a key source of feedback for Spring teams in Microsoft, VMware, and many other communities. Thank you to everyone who participated!

The traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because the market is ‚Äúefficient‚Äù (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.
Coase noted, however, that there are a number of transaction costs to using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is actually more than just the price of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentia‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
Kubernetes has become a platform of choice for building cloud native applications. Kubernetes is highly scalable, highly available, and easy to use, and has many other advantages that make it an excellent choice for building distributed applications.
¬†
However, its distributed nature means monitoring everything that is happening within the cluster can be a challenge. Prometheus and Grafana make our experience better.
¬†
In this article, we will set up a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and deploy Prometheus and Grafana to gather monitoring data and visualize them.
¬†
Understand the tooling

Prometheus is an open source project that was originally created at SoundCloud in 2012, and contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation‚Ä¶</a>

¬†
The issue came up after the web app has been running for a while (several days), the response time of the site slowly increased. And in the end, the requests failed with timeout.
After we reviewed the memory dump and found out that the issue caused by the sites has many unique URLs requests, please refer to the section below.
¬†
Cause:
¬†

The Asp.net application can have a web.config files in each folder, it can help to set the specific configuration for that directory. You can find more details¬†here.¬†
IIS caches the web.config into the machine memory, this can automatically optimize our code by avoiding unnecessary file IO and XML parsing.
To process a request, IIS parses the request URL into directory and looks for the file client requested. Such as the request https://gsm.azur‚Ä¶</a>

These findings provide an important basis for the development of non-invasive therapies.</a>

Scale up: Get more CPU, memory, disk space, and extra features. You scale up by changing the pricing tier of the App Service plan that your app belongs to.
Scale out: Increase the number of VM instances that run your app. You can scale out to as many as 30 instances, depending on your pricing tier.¬†App Service Environments¬†in¬†Isolated¬†tier further increases your scale-out count to 100 instances. You can scale manually or automatically based on predefined rules and schedules.

These existing scaling workflows work well, but you may want to instead have the App Service platform automatically scale your web app without the hassle of defining auto-scaling rules &amp; schedules.

¬†
Today, we‚Äôd like to announce¬†the¬†Docker Compose Language Service in the Docker Extension for VS Code.¬†That‚Äôs right, the Docker Extension will now provide Docker Compose files with IntelliSense,¬†Tooltips, and syntax validation. Here are a few of the incoming features in¬†our 1.18 release:¬†
¬†

IntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)


¬†

Tooltips for Compose keywords (i.e.¬†services, image)¬†



Right-click¬†to¬†format¬†a Compose file¬†(Shift + Alt + F)¬†
YAML Syntax Validation¬†
Hyperlinks for Docker Images¬†

In our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!
¬†
There are more improvements to come!¬†Stay¬†tuned¬†for these features:

More tab completions
Docker Compose schema validation¬†
‚Ä¶ and much more!¬†

We love your feedback! If you have any comments¬†or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the¬†Compose Language Service Repo¬†or the¬†VS Code Docker Repo¬†for general feedback.</a>

Spontaneous laughter was rated as most positive by both groups.</a>

Tau in the cerebrospinal fluid may be a viable biomarker for ALS because levels correlate with disease progression.</a>
