A study of over 900 adults in Germany evaluated the quantity and frequency of eating flavonoid-rich foods and measured bacteria in the gut microbiome to determine if there was an association with blood pressure levels.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/08/210805141141.htm>Two new molecules that generate minute amounts of the gas hydrogen sulfide have been found to prevent skin from aging after being exposed to ultraviolet light found in sunlight. Sunburn is a major cause of premature aging in skin, and a primary risk factor for skin cancer, and other skin problems associated with aging. Now, an international research team has made inroads towards being able to reverse or delay this damage for the first time.</a>

Although this overconsumption is known to contribute to diabetes and other disorders, the exact ways in which eating too much sugar sets the stage for metabolic diseases on a cellular level has been less clear. Now, a team has found that surplus sugar may cause our cellular powerplants -- called mitochondria -- to become less efficient, reducing their energy output.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210729143414.htm>Interventions to prevent obesity in children typically don&#x27;t target the first 1,000 days of life - -a critical period in which environmental and nutritional cues can increase the risk for obesity. A new study demonstrates how changing parents&#x27; health behavior and how clinicians deliver care to mothers and infants decreased excess weight gain in infants.</a>

              Scientists discover early signs of frontotemporal dementia in personalized cerebral organoids

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/07/210726234837.htm>Frontotemporal dementias are a group of fatal and debilitating brain disorders for which there are no cures. Researchers describe how they were able to recreate much of the damage seen in a widely studied form of the disease by growing special types of cerebral organoids in petri dishes. This form of the disease is caused by a genetic mutation in tau, a protein that is a hallmark of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other dementias. By studying these organoids, the scientists discovered how the mutated tau protein may trigger the death of a specific class of neurons known to be vulnerable in frontotemporal dementia. They also showed that they could prevent the death of these neurons by treating the organoids with an experimental drug, originally designed to combat Crohn&#x27;s disease.</a>
