Yes, we are talking about private endpoints. This is a common practice to meet security requirements. Our customers gave us feedback that they also want to use cloud-based load testing to test such private endpoints. Well, now you can! Azure Load Testing uses VNet injection to inject the load generating virtual machines into the same virtual network as your endpoint to enable this scenario. ¬†

In this blog post we&#x27;ll take you through the steps to load test a specific type of private endpoint: public endpoints with access restrictions. These are endpoints that have a public IP address and are accessible over the internet, but access to ‚Ä¶</a>

              On-premises connectivity from Azure Monitor: a serverless approach
              <span class="post-metadata">(33 min | 10003 words)</span>

One of the obvious benefits of open, cloud-based technologies is the ability to integrate a wide range of global services with on-premises resources. If you‚Äôve developed for financial services for any length of time, you know this openness adds another level of complexity to development. When money movement is involved, you‚Äôre going to encounter a higher level of risk and compliance considerations.
This blog highlights just such an issue encountered by the DevStudio engineering team here at Fiserv, and how we solved it. I hope this blog helps you understand not only how our team works but gives you useful context for implementing your own solutions that prioritize security and compliance without sacrificing speed or functionality.

With the Azure Load Testing Preview all you need to do is check a box to get unique datasets when testing your workflow.
¬†
Registering and authorizing your users are major steps in the customer journey lifecycle within an application. You want to make sure that the load test engine receives unique values for registration and login functionalities. Failure to do so can result in duplicate logins and registration errors that abruptly end user sessions. This undermines the quality of the test.
¬†
Azure Load Testing is the powerful tool you‚Äôll want to use to deal with these challenges.

Here‚Äôs a scenario:
You‚Äôre working with a team that‚Äôs launching a new e-commerce membership program in the next quarter and you want to test the application‚Ä¶</a>

What is the URL Rewrite Value?
The URL Rewrite functionality was introduced from Tomcat 8. This feature is similar to mod_rewrite¬† from Apache HTTP Server.

There are 2 ways to use URL rewrite functionality in Tomcat.1. Overwrite the built-in server.xml file with own server.xml file2. Overwrite the built-in context.xml file with own context.xml file

JT is trying to run a Blazor application, using appsettings.json but load a different one depending on what environment is being deployed to. Given that Blazor has the feature built in to load different configs based on the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable, it&#x27;s something that is doable, but how do we do it?
Understanding Static Web Apps config
On SWA we have application configuration and you might think this is the starting point for what you want to do. But this is not quite right, this is actually used to control the configuration for the Azure Functions backend that you use, not the frontend for your application.
In fact, there&#x27;s no way to directly control the client &quot;environment&quot; once it&#x27;s deployed, as the application is bui‚Ä¶</a>

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.</a>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they&#x27;d been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.</a>

Now scientists have shown that the same may be true for cells, uncovering a newly-discovered mechanism that might help prevent the build-up of tangles of proteins commonly seen in dementia. Scientists have identified a new mechanism that appears to reverse the build-up of aggregates, not by eliminating them completely, but rather by &#x27;refolding&#x27; them.</a>

The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population&#x27;s increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.</a>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220502094813.htm>A study of nearly 9,000 children found those who eat a vegetarian diet had similar measures of growth and nutrition compared to children who eat meat. The study also found that children with a vegetarian diet had higher odds of underweight weight status, emphasizing the need for special care when planning the diets of vegetarian kids.</a>

Male baby pregnancies are more likely to result in complications, possibly because they grow faster in the womb and require more nutrients and oxygen than supplied by the mother through the placenta -- the temporary organ that attaches to the wall of the uterus during pregnancy to help the fetus grow and develop.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220426101641.htm>A study is the first to examine if sex significantly affects cognitive outcomes in people who follow individually-tailored, multi-domain clinical interventions. The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals&#x27; overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.</a>
