The detailed steps are provided in the following document:
Mount Azure Storage as a local share (container) - Azure App Service | Microsoft Docs
While Storage Firewall is supported through service endpoint and private endpoint,¬† some configuration details are not addressed within the document. Today, this article will provide detailed steps on mounting the storage account using service endpoint and private endpoint.¬†
¬†
One thing to notice is that mounting the storage from the app service requires some ports to be open.¬†

For blob storage: Port 80 and 443 should be open
For file share: Port 80 and 445 should be open

Features


Observability¬†- Monitor applications hosted inside the cluster


Traffic Splitting¬†- Split Ingress Traffic to different versions of an API. Helps¬† to perform¬†Blue/Green Deployment, A/B Testing, Fault Injection


Distributed Tracing¬†- Trace/Compare Service to Service calls with visualisation


Circuit Breaking¬†- Limit impact of failures due to uncertainty in Network and make services resilient

Getting Tailwind and Radix to play nice together
I‚Äôve been using Tailwind for Placemark‚Äôs
CSS foundation, and Radix for many of its
UI components. This mostly works great, because Radix makes it easy
to style your own components.
However, there‚Äôs a catch: a lot of important UI states for Radix
are distinguished by aria accessibility properties or HTML data-
attributes. For example, when the trigger for a dropdown menu
is engaged, Radix adds data-state&#x3D;&quot;open&quot; to the element.
This is all fine and dandy if you‚Äôre writing new CSS classes, or using

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/debug-packages-and-debuginfod/>We are very happy to announce that debug packages are now available in Arch Linux.
Debug symbols and source listing are provided through our debuginfod instance which can be utilized by debuggers such as gdb and delve.
https://debuginfod.archlinux.org/
A couple of sponsored mirrors are providing the debug repositories while we figure out and communicate the new mirror requirements.
https://america.mirror.pkgbuild.com
https://asia.mirror.pkgbuild.com
https://europe.mirror.pkgbuild.com
Not all packages provide debug packages as enabling it for all packages is an ongoing effort.
For more information, please visit the Debuginfod wiki article, and also our newly renovated Debugging/Getting traces article.</a>

¬†
At Ignite, we announced¬†Azure Container Apps, a serverless application-centric hosting service that enables users to quickly deploy containerized applications and microservices to Azure without the need to configure and manage underlying infrastructure resources or container orchestrators. Azure Container Apps runs on ¬†Azure Kubernetes Service, and includes several open-source projects:¬†Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA),¬†Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), and¬†Envoy. This open-source foundation enables teams to build and run portable applications powered by Kubernetes and open standards without the operational overhead and management complexity of working with the platform directly.

What is the discussion scope of this article?¬†

This article only discuss the Windows Azure App Service, Linux App Service is out of scope of this article.¬†

¬†
What happened?¬†

The Windows Azure App Service platform removed some minor NodeJS version. That could result in some un-expected result if the App Service&#x27;s configuration is not right.¬†

Is that removement is expected behavior?¬†

Yes.
Azure App Service is a PaaS service, and the platform will manage the Windows Node version.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/02/01/recently.html>I read The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn
in January, and it radically reshaped my conception of local
politics and the general arc of city politics in the last 50 years.
Highly, highly recommended stuff.

Brian Lovin did a design crit of Placemark,
which has been powering a big burst of activity on that front.
The energy on Placemark is happening in two semi-parallel efforts:
knocking out the last few core concepts - layers and properties, mostly -
and running through this new, super-helpful list of ideas and
critiques from Brian. The last few days have been super, super
productive as a result, to the extent that I‚Äôll probably crash
and take a few days off in a little bit. But for now, I‚Äôve
got energy and direction, and I‚Äôve got to ride it.

Reading
This paper on Ethnographic Research on Dynamicland
resonated with me. You can read a lot about the technology
and business of these sorts of efforts, but rarely is there
someone looking for the human interactions, and Dynamicland
is one of the most unusual and ambitious projects out there.
Bachmann doesn‚Äôt editorialize much, but I think some
themes emerge, like the tension between ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù/collaboration versus
authority and vision.
It reminded me of The Idea Factory,
that great book about Bell Labs. Research labs are this odd thing -
part of what made Bell Labs great was the ability to work on a slightly
longer timeline, with fewer limitations on what you created. But
that ability was directly a result of the government‚Äôs explicit
permittance of AT&amp;T Bell as a monopoly, during that period of time.
Listening
Townes Van Zandt by Townes Van Zandt

Been on a Townes Van Zandt kick recently, sparked of course
by seeing If I Needed You
pop up in an episode of Patriot.


Almost every time I‚Äôm very productive, it coincides with a full listen-through
of the whole Joanna Newsom ouvre. There‚Äôs nothing like it.</a>

But Nginx does not have an equivalent to the .htaccess file, you need to update the main configuration and reload Nginx for any changes to take effect. NGINX is designed to be efficient.

              Dockershim deprecation and AKS
              <span class="post-metadata">(3 min | 815 words)</span>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/dockershim-deprecation-and-aks/ba-p/3055902>The huge success of Docker in energizing the tech community around containers has been truly amazing to see.¬† As containers are the foundation of Kubernetes, it goes hand in hand that Docker was a core part of the platform. As Kubernetes matured, and the needs of the community and our customers grew, the tight coupling of Docker to Kubernetes through dockershim (the interface between the Kubernetes platform and the Docker runtime) needed to evolve. On 2 December 2020, with the release of Kubernetes 1.20, Kubernetes announced it is deprecating Docker as a container runtime, through the use of dockershim, in a future release of Kubernetes.
¬†
With the upcoming Kubernetes 1.24 release, dockershim will be removed.
¬†
If you are using a supported Kubernetes version in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

For Linux node pools, there is no action required on your part. All supported Kubernetes versions on AKS use containerd as the default runtime for Kubernetes 1.19 and greater.
For Windows Server 2019 node pools, in January 2021, we announced the general availability of containerd as the default container runtime for Kubernetes 1.23 and greater. If you are using a cluster with a Kubernetes version prior to 1.23, you can create a new node pool with containerd enabled before the switch over to it being the default in 1.23 then move your pods to the new pool.

¬†
We work very closely with the community through our participation in the Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIG) from Storage, to Windows and everything in between and I&#x27;d like to thank both the community and our engineering teams for the work to get to this milestone.</a>

¬†
In our¬†previous article¬†we explored how to deploy Grafana and Prometheus on AKS. However, despite Prometheus being an excellent way to monitor your AKS cluster, it lacks some functionality to save metrics for future use and enable us to query historical data.
¬†
Prometheus is a metrics collector, it can be used to collect metrics from any source, and it can be used to generate graphs. However, it is not a data storage solution and therefore isn&#x27;t not focused on storing data for historical purposes. Prometheus has its storage solution and supports both on-disk storage as well as remote locations. You can configure a lot of options but the data management options are limited. This is where Thanos can help.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/announcing-app-service-environment-v3-migration-feature-public/ba-p/3059611>We are happy to announce the availability of the initial public preview of the App Service Environment (ASE) v3 migration tool. With this feature, you&#x27;ll be able to migrate your existing ASE as well as the apps running on that ASE to ASEv3. ASEv3 provides a number of feature differences¬†as well as performance enhancements and potential reduced overall costs¬†compared to previous versions. To get a complete overview on ASEv3, read the ASEv3 focused App Service Environment overview.

Check out the following docs to learn more about migrating to ASEv3:

- Migrate to App Service Environment v3
- How to Migrate to ASEv3

Please note, at this time, the public preview supports a subset of possible ASE configurations. Be sure to review the supported scenarios to see if you can migrate at this time using the feature and stay tuned for updates as we release additional capabilities.

An Azure portal experience for migration will be available at the start of February, 2022. Be on the lookout for additional announcements.

If your ASE isn&#x27;t supported for migration¬†using the migration feature and your ASE isn&#x27;t listed under one of the upcoming supported scenarios, you have the option to migrate to ASEv3 manually. See the migration alternatives¬†for more details.</a>

Researchers from DZNE and the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) come to this conclusion based on a study of more than 1,000 older adults. To this end, various proteins were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid: They served as so-called biomarkers that indicate inflammatory processes of the nervous system. As it turned out, some of these molecules seem to be part of a damage control program of the immune system, which could be useful for the development of new drugs.</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/01/220112094014.htm>With nearly 10% of the world&#x27;s population affected, type 2 diabetes is a major public health issue. An excessively sedentary lifestyle and a too-caloric diet encourage the development of this metabolic disease by altering the functioning of pancreatic cells and making blood sugar regulation less effective. However, fat, which is often cited as the ideal culprit, could be rehabilitated. Indeed, fat does not necessarily aggravate the disease and could even play a protective role: by studying insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, scientists have shown that these cells suffered less from excess sugar when they had previously been exposed to fat.</a>
