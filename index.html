We came across many uses cases wherein customers wished to do more with their JMeter scripts, like ability to manipulate variables, or to use logs to debug the conditions. It is almost possible to achieve many of the use cases through the commonly available JMeter elements and augment them with the rich source of plugins available. There may be instances wherein it would be required for the test authors to script in order to manipulate the data before or after it is passed to samplers.

              Zero to Hero with K8s Apps in the Azure Marketplace

            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/zero-to-hero-with-k8s-apps-in-the-azure-marketplace/ba-p/3655806>Our ISV partners have been asking for a way to provide an easy way to package their Kubernetes based solutions into the Marketplace and we&#x27;re excited to announce K8s Apps to meet their needs.
¬†
ISV&#x27;s are excited about this because it allows them to transact their offers in the Azure Marketplace via CI/CD.¬† This includes 48 hour publishing turnaround, automated security vetting and a self-service experience.¬† Customers look forward to the easy deployment, automated patching and using these offers to decrement their MACC.
¬†
Since then, a lot of information has come out and our partners are looking for guidance on how to get started.¬† I&#x27;ve recorded this End-To-End video which walks through the steps of an ISV Creating and Publishing an Offer as well as a Customer Purchasing the offer.¬† This is a more detailed version of the demo seen at Ignite.
¬†



¬†
¬†
All of the code available for the Minecraft As A Service demo is on GitHub.
¬†
If you are an ISV and interested in getting started in the K8s Apps in the Marketplace, I recommend the following:
¬†

Read the blog for the Ignite Announcement
Watch the full demo video
Fill out the Public Preview Invite Form
Attend the Mastering Container Offers Workshop

¬†
When you&#x27;re ready to publish your offer to the marketplace, these docs will guide you:

Create the Offer
Prepare your Technical Assets
Create/Publish offer in Partner Center
Deploy the Offer

Come join some of our other partners that have already taken the leap!

Tetrate Istio Distro
Elastic Cloud

I hope this helps you on your journey into K8s Apps on the Azure Marketplace and we&#x27;ll see your offer available for customers soon.</a>

What is Azure Web Pubsub:
Web PubSub is an Azure-managed service that helps developers easily build real-time web applications using websockets and publish-subscribe pattern.¬†Any platform supporting WebSocket APIs can connect to the service easily, e.g. web pages, mobile applications, edge devices, etc. The service manages the WebSocket connections for you and allows up to 100K *concurrent¬†connections. It provides powerful APIs for you to manage these clients and deliver real-time messages.

However, as users migrate large scale workloads to containers, they often create a large number of AKS clusters for various reasons ‚Äì clusters in different environments (QA/test, staging, prod), clusters in different regions for high availability or localization/proximity, or using clusters to achieve strong isolation between workloads.

Most customers tell us they prefer to run a larger number of smaller clusters, but some very large workloads can be run much more efficiently on bigger clusters. To support this, we have increased the number of nodes you can have in a single Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from 1,000 to 5,000.¬† This will allow you to reduce the number of clusters needed to run your workloads, reducing the operational overhead needed to support application teams.

When using the uptime SLA you can request a quota increase across all node pools in the cluster by raising a support request.¬†

The way this field resolver will work is that if you provide a tag argument to related then it&#x27;ll return posts that also have that tag (while first validating that the tag is a tag of the Post), and if you don&#x27;t provide a tag argument, it&#x27;ll return all post‚Ä¶</a>

              WordPress: Error establishing a database connection

We will only discuss wordpress on Linux App service in this blog.
¬†
Sometimes, we may encounter the following error when accessing wordpress website.
¬†

¬†
It is very easy to understand that there is something wrong with the connection between the website and database. But how can we find more detailed information regarding this error?
¬†
We can enable WordPress debugging mode to check the detailed error message. The steps are as below.
¬†
1.Login to the newui of the scm site.(https://{sitename}.scm.azurewebsites.net/newui)
2.Click File Manager and find the wp-config.php file under site/wwwroot folder.
¬†

¬†¬†
3.Change &quot;define( &#x27;WP_DEBUG&#x27;, false);&quot; to &quot;define( &#x27;WP_DEBUG&#x27;, true );&quot; in wp-config.php file. We can edit it directly from the newui portal.
¬†
With this change, you can try to access the wordpress site again without restarting the app service. You will see the detailed error message when accessing the website.

¬†
You may see below¬†possible error messages.¬†I added some suggestions for each kind of error for your reference.

With today‚Äôs preview release, we‚Äôre improving support for Next.js on Azure Static Web Apps.
What‚Äôs new
In this preview we‚Äôre focusing on making zero-config deployments with Next.js even easier than it‚Äôs been before by including support for Server-Side Rendering and Incremental Static Regeneration (SSR and ISR respectively), API Routes, advanced image compression, and Next.js Auth. In this post, we want to highlight three features that make building Next.js apps on Azure more powerful.

              How to set blob storage firewall accessing from app service only
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9497 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-set-blob-storage-firewall-accessing-from-app-service-only/ba-p/3638851>Scenario
Goal: Blob storage can access only from the app service.So, you want to set the blob storage firewall for inbound traffic.
¬†
Blob storage firewall limitation in this scenario
1. IP address
¬†IP network rules have no effect on requests originating from the same Azure region as the storage account.
¬†See¬†Grant access from an internet IP range¬†
2. Service tag
¬†There isn&#x27;t an App service tag.

¬†
ps. When clients request blob storage through app service, blob storage receives not App service IP but Client IP.
¬†
Workaround
1. Add IP address when app service and storage are located in a different region.
When resources are located in a different region, the IP address firewall setting works.
2. Firewall with Virtual Network
When blob storage uses VNet firewall, app service must be integrated with VNet.
If you want to read what is VNet integration, see¬†VNet integration¬†

¬†
Before setting VNet integration, you must check limitations.
Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
¬†
1. Set Vnet Integration on the app service
Add VNet to your app service.
I use &quot;firwall-storage-vnet&quot; VNet as below.
¬†

¬†
2. Blob storage firewall setting with VNet which is integrated with app service

3. If you use a function app, please add WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET &#x3D; 1
A value of¬†1¬†enables your function app to scale when you have your storage account restricted to a virtual network.¬†
You can see the detail about this setting¬†website_contentovervnet</a>

Today, we&#x27;re excited to share that you can deploy Nuxt 3 applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps.
¬†
While Nuxt 2 is known for its ease of use, Nuxt 3 brings even faster performance and improved developer experience with a thrilling new set of underlying technologies and features. With the release of Nuxt 3‚Äôs release candidate in April 2022, developers witnessed a complete re-architect of the framework. Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge¬†also work with Azure Static Web Apps.
¬†
What‚Äôs new in Nuxt 3?¬†
¬†

Zero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps¬†
API routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories¬†
Vue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability¬†
Nitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static¬†
Vite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production¬†

Universal rendering vs static rendering
¬†
Previously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.
¬†
With Nuxt 3&#x27;s support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering.¬†
¬†
To learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2022/10/03/recently.html>Summer screeched to a halt a few days ago and I‚Äôm still reeling from it.
The dehumidifiers turned off, the humidifiers on. The A/C off,
the heat on. I‚Äôm still, more than a year after leaving the west coast,
grateful for the presence of seasons to keep me aware of time passing,
but now I‚Äôm aware of time passing.

I got some film photos back, out of my Hasselblad and Olympus XA-2
cameras. This time both rolls had some good photos on them. Taking
the film out of the Hasselblad, I broke one of the light seals, again,
so I have to fix it, again. There‚Äôs a man who sells a kit to fix
the seal on eBay - a piece of mylar and a few tiny slices of foam.
It works. He must do some robust business, given how easily
those parts seem to break.

In September, I traveled a little bit, to SatSummit,

              Application Insights Sampling in Azure Functions and missing invocations
              <span class="post-metadata">(31 min | 9346 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/application-insights-sampling-in-azure-functions-and-missing/ba-p/3641491>For Azure Functions -
¬†

Adaptive sampling is enabled by default.
Fixed-rate sampling is not supported.
Ingestion sampling only applies when no other sampling is in effect. Therefore, this is also disabled by default in the wake of point #1 above.

¬†
¬†
If you expect data (invocations) under Monitor but do not find it as shown in screenshot below, you have either changed Host.Results category to Warning (or above) level; or your application telemetry is getting sampled. To fix the former, open Host.json file and change the Host.Results category to Information level.
¬†
{
¬† &quot;logging&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬† &quot;fileLoggingMode&quot;: &quot;always&quot;,
¬†¬†¬† &quot;logLevel&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;default&quot;: &quot;Information&quot;,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Host.Results&quot;: &quot;Information&quot;,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Function&quot;: &quot;Error&quot;,
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;Host.Aggregator&quot;: &quot;Trace&quot;
¬†¬†¬† }
¬† }
}
¬†
¬†
If Host.Results category is already set at Information level, disable telemetry sampling as the next step.
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†
To disable the sampling, set &quot;isEnabled&quot;: false in host.json file as shown below -
¬†
{
¬† &quot;logging&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬† &quot;applicationInsights&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;samplingSettings&quot;: {
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;isEnabled&quot;: false
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† }
¬†¬†¬† }
¬† }
}
¬†
After disabling sampling, you can confirm it by running a query similar to the following; RetainedPercentage should show 100%.
¬†

¬†
¬†
¬†
¬†
At this point, the function invocations should start appearing under Monitor on Azure Portal UI.</a>

Node.js has two module systems:

¬†
1) CommonJS: The de facto standard for modules in Node.js currently¬† is CommonJS. CommonJS modules are defined in normal .js files using¬†module.exports or .cjs.
Modules can be used later within other .js files with the¬†require()¬†function.

Today, we are announcing the preview of passwordless connections for Java applications to Azure database and eventing services, letting you finally shift away from using passwords.

Security Challenges with Passwords
¬†
Passwords should be used with caution, and developers must never place passwords in an unsecured location. Many Java applications connect to backend data, cache, messaging, and eventing services using usernames and passwords, or other sensitive credentials such as access tokens or connection strings. If exposed, the passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as a sales catalog that you built for an upcoming campaig‚Ä¶</a>

Since then we have been actively cutting down the number of projects depending on python2 in our repositories, and we have finally been able to drop it from our distribution. If you still have python2 installed on your system consider removing it and any python2 package.
If you still require the python2 package you can keep it around, but please be aware that there will be no security updates. If you need a patched package please consult the AUR, or use an unofficial user repository.</a>

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.</a>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they&#x27;d been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.</a>

The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population&#x27;s increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.</a>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.</a>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer&#x27;s Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.</a>

Now, researchers have found that while these efforts have been effective, the incidence of higher-grade disease and metastasis at diagnosis have risen.</a>

The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals&#x27; overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.</a>

Three slices of bread or one teaspoon of table salt will do it, and chances are your daily sodium intake is far greater. More than 90% of Americans consume too much sodium, which can lead to hypertension, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. A new article provides a comprehensive review of scientific literature on sodium reduction strategies in food production.</a>
