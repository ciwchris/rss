SaaS is a business and software delivery model that enables organisations to offer their solution in a service centric approach at scale usually on a subscription basis. SaaS adoption usually targets growth driven transformation, market expansion, operational simplicity and faster innovation with faster¬† product releases.
SaaS infrastructures offer better cost efficiencies by leveraging economies of scale, resource pooling and sharing, and increased utilisation of the infrastructure in general. SaaS infra pattern is especially attractive for ISV‚Äôs since SaaS accelerates tenant onboarding, enables data collection and mining for platform users (e.g calculate CAC, CLTV, MRR, product consumption metrics‚Ä¶) and makes it much easier to ‚Ä¶</a>

There are two parts to WordPress:

WP Admin: Also called the backend, admin panel, or admin dashboard, this is the admin area where you can manage your website. You can edit posts and pages, install themes and plugins, add or remove users, and change website settings.
Frontend: This is the section which is accessible to your users. This is where your users can read blog posts, make purchases, or participate in a forum, depending on the kind of website you build using WordPress.

A relatively common problem is that the WP Admin has low performance even when the frontend works fast for your users. Most performance enhancements that you do makes only your frontend faster. This makes it difficult ‚Ä¶</a>

However, after you export the App Service Certificate from Azure Portal, when you are going to upload it to Azure Application Gateway or use it in the Azure VM or on-prem VM, you would find out sometimes it would need the &quot;password&quot;.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the managed Kubernetes offering from Azure, allows customers to offload the operational overhead to Azure, thus letting the user focus primarily on their workloads and business logic. We are seeing two sets of user trends along the Kubernetes adoption curve. First, organizations that are already using containers and/or Kubernetes in their on-premises and cloud environments are looking to AKS to reduce their operational burden and leverage the Azure cloud ecosystem. Secondly, we also see organizations earlier in the adoption cycle that are looking to experiment and discover Kubernetes‚Äô fit‚Ä¶</a>

And I haven‚Äôt really given an update on Placemark, the product and business, in a while. Writing about an operating business is a different thing that writing feature announcements or essays about technology: the ramifications of honesty, spin, or disclosure are so much more vast and unpredictable. This is why we often learn about people‚Äôs trials or a company‚Äôs struggles only years later, but at the time everyone exudes confidence.
But, having drafted something about this a few times and edited myself into knots, I figure it‚Äôs better to just write something. The best writing always comes after I‚Äôve scrapped a draft anyway.

              <a target="_blank" href=https://macwright.com/2023/01/27/valtown.html>Last week I joined val.town as Steve Krouse‚Äôs cofounder. Val.town is a system for programming in the small, for writing short programs in TypeScript that can link together into something larger. It‚Äôs for writing that scheduled web scraper or basic API that you wanted to make but didn‚Äôt want to add to your pile of servers on AWS or GCP. It‚Äôs already a lot of fun to use, and is going to keep getting better.

Placemark lives. It‚Äôs still getting better every week. It‚Äôs been about two years since I formally started it, and it‚Äôs grown into a great product with the help of supportive and creative customers. I‚Äôve been relatively quiet about Placemark-the-business, despite writing a steady flow of blog posts on features &amp; improvements on placemark.io. But, soon - I‚Äôll publish a state of Placemark in the near future.
I‚Äôm tremendously excited about Val.town. It‚Äôs a small team in Brooklyn and Seattle, with lots of creative energy. I think we‚Äôll be able to take this opportunity and make something great, something that in retrospect always should have existed.</a>

Behind the scenes, it runs on a managed Kubernetes cluster and includes several open source components, including Dapr for microservices creation and execution, Envoy Proxy for ingress functions, and KEDA for event-driven autoscaling. Again, you do not have to install these components yourself. All you need to do is enable and/or configure your container app to use these components.

In this blog, we will see how can we scale Container Apps based on Redis Streams with the Azure managed instance of Redis, i.e. Azure Cache for Redis.¬†We will be¬†referring to the KEDA trigger specification for Redis Streams (Scale applications based on Redis Streams) to configure our Container App.¬†This specification describes the Redis-s‚Ä¶</a>

Zone Redundant App Service errors and solutions for different scenarios:
¬†
Scenario 1
Symptom:¬†Web sockets error when accessing an App service web app in an app service plan which has enabled Zone Redundancy.
Error: Failed to start the transport &#x27;WebSockets&#x27;: Error: There was an error with the transport.
Root Cause: This issue happened when these 3 conditions are met.

Zone Redundancy enabled.
Web Sockets set to¬†on (in App service Settings -&gt; Configuration -&gt; General Settings)
ARR affinity set to off (in App service Settings -&gt; Configuration -&gt; General Settings)

Solution: Enable¬†ARR affinity for the app service

Scenario 2
Symptom:¬† Failed to scale down a¬†Linux App service plan --e.g. from P1V3 to P1V2, it failed with message ---You cannot change the OS hosting your app at this time. Please recreate your app with the desired OS
Network trace shows--- http 400 bad request error when sending the PUT request to https://management.azure.com/
Root Cause:¬†¬†¬† App Service Plan with fewer than 3 workers are not allowed for zone redundancy. Requested number of workers: 2
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† App service plan has Zone redundancy enabled with autoscale¬†configured with an¬†Auto Scale out¬†rule, setting¬†the minimum and default instance count to be less than 3.

Some of you may have learned about these new storage providers during the annual Build conference and/or from this preview announcement blog post.
¬†
Durable Functions enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the serverless Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. We believe the new storage providers will enable a host of new scenarios for apps using Durable Functions because they allow apps to run at a higher scale, with greater price-performance efficiency, and with more portability compared to the default option Azure Storage.

Going about designing the authentication flow can be confusing and not straightforward. When load testing an application, this generally is the first step in the user journey. ¬†Supplying client credentials through a UI is not possible when load testing an application, so is evaluating how to implement specific authentication flows available on Azure, as they can be tedious and time consuming as well.
Within this series, we will cover the authentication flows and scenarios that are possible with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the identity provider.
At the end of the blog, you will be able to

Use Azure AD to Authenticate a web application hosted on Azure App Service using the client credential grant flow.

Cloud computing revolutionized how a business can establish its digital presence. Nowadays, by leveraging cloud features such as scalability, elasticity, and convenience, businesses can deploy, grow, or test an environment in every corner of the world without worrying about building the required infrastructure.
¬†
Unlike the traditional model, which was based on notifying the service provider to set up the resources for customers in advance, in an on-demand model, cloud providers implement application programming interfaces (API) that can be used by customers to deploy resources on demand. This allows the customer to access an unlimited amount of resources on-demand and only pay for the resources they use without worrying about th‚Ä¶</a>

              <a target="_blank" href=https://archlinux.org/news/php-82-update-and-introduction-of-legacy-branch/>The php packages have been updated to the latest version 8.2. In
addition to this, a new set of php-legacy packages have been
introduced. These will follow the oldest but still actively supported
PHP branch. This enables users to install the latest version but also
introduces the option to use third party applications that might rely
on an older version. Both branches will be kept up to date following
our rolling release model. php and php-legacy can be installed at the
same time as the latter uses a -legacy suffix for its binaries and
configuration files.
In addition to this, the php7 packages have been removed as they
reached end of life. The imap extension will no longer be provided as
it relies on the c-client library which has been abandoned for many
years.</a>

              How to use PHP8 for App Service Windows
              <span class="post-metadata">(32 min | 9470 words)</span> 
            </summary>
            <div class="post-content">
              <a target="_blank" href=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-use-php8-for-app-service-windows/ba-p/3709106>Note that official support for PHP 8 will only be available on Linux, as a result of this¬†App Service¬†will only support PHP 8 on¬†Apps Service Linux instances.¬†For additional information on this topic:¬†PHP on App Service,¬†php.internals: Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows.
¬†
This article will demonstrate on how to use PHP 8 for App Service Windows, since there would be no official support from Microsoft for it, please use at your own risk.
¬†
Generally, we are following this post:¬†How to use a Custom PHP runtime for App Service Windows - (azureossd.github.io)¬†to download a custom PHP runtime and map Handler for it.
¬†
1. Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.

¬†
2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:

¬†
3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from¬†PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases¬†and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:
¬†
¬†
mkdir php
curl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\php.zip
cd php
unzip php.zip
¬†
¬†


¬†
4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is &quot;*.php&quot;, the¬†Script processor is &quot;C:\home\php\php-cgi.exe&quot;. Then save it. All the configuration is done.

¬†
5. To verify it, we can create an¬†&quot;index.php&quot; file under C:\home\site\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:
¬†
&lt;?
phpinfo();
¬†
¬†

¬†
I hope you enjoy it.</a>

Popular &quot;orb&quot; icon in results, has been replaced by a &quot;shield&quot; icon in a slight redesign to accomodate for the upcoming AI tools.
Added an icon to host links to manipulate the results. Currently it is &quot;Open in Web Archive&quot; and &quot;More from this site&quot;. We will be adding more in the future.
Maps: UI design improvements to Directions/Navigation Controls (button icons/spacing/padding/etc)
Maps: Addition of &quot;My Location&quot; button, for setting starting-point as user-location
Maps: Addition of a &quot;Drop Pin&quot; button, for manually setting a start point via mouse


Improved
You can&#x27;t directly switch from a lense to a non-All search (e.g. Images, News) with JS disabled #61 @gesumin
Plan selection does not work without JS on onboarding


Fixed
Zero results for ‚ÄúBest Headphones‚Äù ‚Äì is shopping search broken right now? #1109 @quinncom
Search results sections do not all honor personalized results settings #1133 @ryandary
Both &quot;Web&quot; and &quot;Lens&quot; being shown as active when a lens is enabled
Maps: Exiting out of the Directions UI (when a route is on screen), not properly clearing the Origin/Destination/User-Location-Dot</a>

              A method to run multiple applications in single App Service

There is a solution - Docker Compose. However, it is still in Preview status, so it is not recommended to use it in Production environment. There are also some limitations. In this article, I would like to use a sample app service to introduce a method to do the same thing by using nginx and custom docker container.
¬†
Note
The current method does not obey the recommendation of Docker that a docker container should host only one service, and we actually recommend customers use Azure Container App for hosting multiple applications.
¬†
Design
We will create a Docker container to have nginx installed and use it as a reverse proxy to redirect the request from external to different applications.

However, you may also choose to package the Spring Boot project to a war file and deploy it to Tomcat. This article shows how you can do it.
Firstly, you need to modify your Spring Boot application entrance class to entend SpringBootServletInitializer class and override configure method:

@SpringBootApplication  
public class DemoApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer {  
    @Override
