        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years later, I’m still taking a lot of notes in notebooks. I’ve bought many editions of Field Notes, which I still love. And emptied many Muji pens on the page.
But I have to admit: I’ve only reopened my archived notebooks a handful of times. Once or twice to retrieve contemporaneous notes about business events, and a few times to refresh my memory of the early part of a book while writing a review. So what are notes for?
Part of the Field Notes motto is “I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now.” That captures part of it, but memory isn’t the only lens to think about note-taking.
A common thread here is semblance. Note-taking is about building a semblance of understanding, in the same way that exercise can be about creating a semblance of control.

I’ve dissed “knowledge graphs” ad-nauseum – that by virtue of never labeling the edges they never capture real relationship between items and make vague thinking easy, that none of their implementers roll up their sleeves and implement better graph layout so they’re readable and instead use d3’s force directed graph or graphviz, that they just never really become useful.
But whatever: is it really about using the graph, or is it about looking at it?
You can feel like you understand something without knowing anything about it, and you can understand something without feeling like you do. Both are problematic. Creating notes and other symbols of knowledge is a way to affect that balance.
Maybe the real metacognition isn’t about having a mirror image of your brain encoded in a computer, but just having a mirror. Having a nice birch box filled with notebooks or a nice dense graph that symbolizes all the things you’ve noted, so that you can learn and forget comfortably. The world will always be too big to understand, but my box of notebooks, that I know.]]></summary>

Researchers looked at whether interventions such as aerobic and strength or resistance training, had helped participants with asthma. Although they found that these interventions worked, patients with asthma may have had difficulty undertaking them because of their difficulty traveling to fitness groups or because the interventions were not suitable for people with additional health conditions. But the team say that digital interventions -- such as video appointments, smartwatches and mobile apps -- could remove some of these barriers and enable patients to carry out home-based programs in future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a little yearly round-up over on Placemark.
I’m not one for concrete resolutions or nostalgia, so on with the usual, a Recently.
Reading
I read Policing the Open Road
on Rebecca’s suggestion. It’s an incredible book that I’ll
probably re-read soon, because the central conflict that it sets out feels so thoroughly
deadlocked, unresolvable, and important - the interplay between privacy, safety, police
power, and freedom.
I don’t agree with all of it, but Jon McLoone’s explanatio of why Wolfram is not open source
resonated strongly with me. Placemark, as I’ve said before, is not planning on being
open source, though components of the application will be released. Some of my reasoning
lines up with Wolfram’s pretty precisely. The central piece for me, I think, is just
what the community means - where communities come from, how they agree on what they
do, how they collect and disperse. Magical thinking around what constitutes
community and how it operates is my biggest gripe about open source ideology in this
day and age: too many people happily ignore the top-heaviness of some communities,
or don’t think about where the direction, leadership, contributions, and standards
come from.
Watching

Watch Vampire’s Kiss. That is all.
Expect to see in the new year: more, probably shorter, blog posts. More photos.
And Placemark, out in the wild.]]></summary>

Therefore, if you want either oh-my-zsh or oh-my-posh, or both, you should configure it by yourself.
 
Throughout this post, I'm going to show how to configure your shell environment for both.
 

This GitHub repository provides the working shell script source for your reference.

Let's configure oh-my-zsh on your Azure Cloud Shell. Make sure that you see the Bash Shell prompt. If not, enter the bash command to switch your prompt to Bash.
