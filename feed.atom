of New York before the snow takes over.
Reading
I finally finished Barbarian Days.
I think it took over a month to get through it - kept losing momentum by
taking a few days off from reading during a trip. It was good - of course
it was good, it won a Pulitzer. I enjoyed it, but I wish I enjoyed reading it more,
and I’m not sure why.
There have been hundreds of articles written about Twitter and FTX this month.
I read a lot of both, and none of the FTX articles particularly stuck out,
but jwz’s writing has been a fun way to follow
along with some of the Mastodon/Twitter hype. That’s jwz of Mozilla, Netscape Navigator, and DNA Lounge.
Nick Maggiulli’s How Much Growth Can You Expect?
was an interesting read, but even moreso I appreciate that all of his
analysis is open source on GitHub
and serves as a neat example learning a bit of R.
Listening

Not a big month for new music, the only thing that really hooked me in November was
Pavane pour une infante défunte by Maurice Ravel.
I’m trying to learn it on guitar (like most classical, there’s a great tab
on classtab), but the original version on piano is so lovely.
Watching

Serial Mom was, I think, the first John
Waters film I’ve watched. Made me want to watch more from the back catalog.

I’m continuing the mission of watching all the Nic Cage films - at
18% so far - with Matchstick Men.
It’s one of the good ones.
Finished Only Murders in The Building,
which has a sort of extreme mass-appeal quality that’s become more boring than
appealing lately.]]></summary>

Between the developer energy wasted on crypto, which has produced

We walked through how to set up, run and analyze user loads with Azure Load Testing in part one of this series. In part two we will test different load patterns to show you how simulate them in Apache JMeter. A load pattern specifies how the simulated user load is adjusted during a load test.
While you might run smoke tests regularly with minimal load to avoid regressions, big events present scenarios to consider different types of load testing.

Clue 1: Check domain resolving behavior and network connectivity
 
Just like most of the network related cases, we firstly want to verify the connectivity between resources, in this case, we could use kudu in app service and try to reach out the storage account.
 
 
nslookup <your_storage>.file.core.windows.net

Many ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) are exchanging information with devices, applications, services, or humans. In many cases the information passed can be a file or a blob. Each of these ISVs would need to implement such a service. In the past few months, I discussed this capability with several (over 4) different customers, each with slightly unique needs. When I tried to generalize the need, it was clear: they wanted a quick, safe means to exchange files with customers or devices. 
 
So, I tried to translate these asks into user stories: 
 
As a service provider, I need my customers to upload content in a secure, easy-to-maintain micro-service exposed as an API (application programming interfaces) so that I can process the content uploaded and perform an action on it.

Azure Functions will support .NET 7 serverless apps hosted on all Windows and Linux SKUs, including Consumption plan, Elastic Premium plan, and App Service plans. Customers can start to test in limited cloud regions (e.g West Central US, France Central) by the end of today. Additional rollouts to fully deploy the RTM version across our fleet are expected to be done by the 2nd week of November.

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.]]></summary>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they'd been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.]]></summary>

It is the second clinical trial to show that the drug, sodium selenate, may slow cognitive decline and neuro-degenerative damage that is the hallmark of many dementias including Alzheimer's Disease.]]></summary>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>

The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals' overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.]]></summary>
