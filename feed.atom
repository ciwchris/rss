Customers benefit from Azure Load Testing (ALT) because the service abstracts away the environment setup and teardown, needed for high scale loads; and simplifies the analysis of the test results through the built in test criteria and integrated results dashboard. In this blogpost, we will demonstrate how you can gain more benefit from the automation and customization options provided by the service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are proud to announce that the migration to Git packaging succeeded! 🥳
Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!
Package sources are now available on GitLab. Note that the bugtracker is still flyspray and that merge requests are not accepted as of now. 
We intend to open the issue tracker and merge requests on the Gitlab package repos in the near future.
Mirrors are syncing again, but it may take a bit of time until your mirror of choice has caught up.
For users
Update your system and merge the pacman pacnew /etc/pacman.conf.pacnew file. This is required as we have moved the [community] repository into [extra].
$ pacman -Syu "pacman>=6.0.2-7"

For users of the now deprecated asp tool, you will need to switch to pkgctl:
$ pacman -Syu "devtools>=1:1.0.0-1"
$ pkgctl repo clone linux

For some more detailed instructions on how to obtain PKGBUILDs see the corresponding wiki article.
For packagers
Before starting, first uninstall devtools-git-poc and remove any repos from your filesystem that you cloned during the git proof-of-concept testing.
Make sure you have both, an updated devtools and pacman on your system:
$ pacman -Syu "devtools>=1:1.0.0-1" "pacman>=6.0.2-7"

Additionally clean up old chroots in /var/lib/archbuild/
$ rm -rf /var/lib/archbuild/
# or optionally, use the --clean option for pkgctl build *ONCE*
$ pkgctl build --clean

For instruction on how to use pkgctl, please take a look at the "How to be a packager" wiki article and also consult the man page of each subcommand for further information:
$ man pkgctl-build
$ man pkgctl-repo-clone]]></summary>

As with every article in this series this has been driven by customer use cases. In this instance the customer desired having a development web application on a public domain but ring fenced to only allow access to authenticated users from Azure AD.
 
Before we dive deeper into the use case and implementation its important to understand the various components if unfamiliar. I will speak about benefits of certain technologies as I go through but it is worth taking a quick look at these links as a level set if you need it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Friday morning (2023-05-19) the Git packaging migration will start until Sunday (2023-05-21). The Arch Linux packaging team will not be able to update packages in any of the repositories during this period.
Notification when the migration starts, and when it is completed, will be published on the [arch-dev-public] mailing list.
How does this impact Arch Linux users?
The [testing] repository will be split into [core-testing] and [extra-testing], the [staging] repository will be split into [core-staging] and [extra-staging]. The [community] repository will be merged into [extra] and will therefore be empty after the migration.
All affected repositories will be provided as empty repositories for a transition period after the migration. For regular users, this means that everything works as before.
Note: After the migration is done, users that have the testing repositories enabled need to include the new repositories ([core-testing] and [extra-testing] instead of [testing]) in their pacman.conf before updating their system.
Other changes:
SVN access is discontinued and will dissappear.
The svn2git mirror will no longer be updated.
asp, which relies on the svn2git mirror, will stop working. It is replaced by pkgctl repo clone.
How does this impact Arch Linux tier 1 mirrors?
During the migration rsync and HTTP access will be shut down. We will send an email notification to arch-mirrors once everything has been finished.
How does this impact Arch Linux packagers?
Packagers will not be able to patch and update their packages. The internal Tier 0 mirror is also going to be disabled for the duration of this migration.]]></summary>

There is no way to do it from Azure portal. But the below Power shell script can help customers list all the subnets used for Private Endpoints.
 

List all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoint using PowerShell script

$privateEndpoints = Get-AzPrivateEndpoint
$subnetIds = $privateEndpoints | ForEach-Object { $_.Subnet.Id }

How To Enable Network Security Group for Private Endpoints 
By default, network policies are disabled for a subnet in a virtual network.
You need to assign the NSG name first in this subnet, then enable NSG in “Network Policy for Private Endpoint”, then the PE will be applied the NSG rule.

Suggestions for Using Custom DNS.


Set up less than 3 custom DNS servers. 


         Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses the CoreDNS project for cluster DNS management and resolution. Based on observation, it only takes the first three custom DNS server settings. If you specify more than three custom DNS servers, AKS will only use the first three.

Of course you can have a good set of load tests but still, incidents in production environments can happen and it's crucial to have available data that can help to understand what happened so application can be improved and prevent replications.

It finally came to the new protocol HTTP/2 announced by IETF in 2015, which is a more modernized, faster and more secure version, almost all major web browsers are on board so far.
As one of the powerful app platform providers, App service team also announced the support for the HTTP/2 protocol  for all apps hosted on App Service in March 2018.
 
What are the key differences from HTTP/1.x on app service?
 

HTTP/2 is binary
Fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
Ability to use one connection for parallelism
Has one TCP/IP connection per origin
Uses header compression to reduce overh…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From a previous announcement on the Minimum TLS Cipher Suite (preview), the feature only supported the configuration through the API. The good news is that now users can configure the minimum TLS cipher suite for incoming requests through the Azure portal! This feature is currently only supported on Premium SKUs and above. This article will go through what cipher suites are and how they work on App Service, the minimum TLS cipher suite experience on Azure portal, and more information about an upcoming change that will happen before General Availability (GA).
 
What are cipher suites and how do they work on App Service? 
A cipher suite is a set of instructions that contains algorithms and protocols to help secure network connections between clients and servers. By default, the front-end's O…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s face it, moving a line-of-business application that’s been designed to run on-prem, or even on a virtual machine, to the cloud can be intimidating. The good news is that you don’t need to go full-on cloud native all at once. Azure App Service offers a comprehensive platform for hosting .NET applications in the cloud with minimal code changes needed to the existing web app.
In this article I want to talk about how Azure App Service makes an excellent first step for a .NET application’s cloud journey. By the end of this article, I want you to have enough information to have a foundation for taking your taking your app to the cloud – and honestly to decide whether it’s the right decision at all.
 
While we think about the first step of the cloud journey, we need to be thoughtful about m…]]></summary>
