        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insulin is a key hormone in energy metabolism and blood sugar regulation. Normal insulin function in the body may be disturbed by e.g. overweight, leading to decreased insulin sensitivity and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Researchers have noticed that standing is associated with better insulin sensitivity. Increasing the daily standing time may therefore help prevent chronic diseases.]]></summary>

Flying with a mask on, trying to evaluate whether that a wedding guest might’ve fibbed about their vaccination status, reading about the Delta variant and the new hotspots. I don’t like it.

But that’ll be it for travel for a little while.
It seems like everyone has been thinking about the meaning of work and motivation recently, and I have been too. There’s are.na’s Charles Broskoski on motivation, articles about people losing interest in their jobs, articles about burnout, and a trend on TikTok (sigh) of tech workers quitting their jobs.

These guidelines focus on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), which affects the arteries. As the inside of the arteries become clogged up by fatty deposits, they can no longer supply enough blood to the body. This process is the main cause of heart attacks, strokes, PAD and sudden death where arteries become completely blocked. The most important way to prevent these conditions is to adopt a healthy lifestyle throughout life, especially not smoking, and to treat risk factors.]]></summary>
