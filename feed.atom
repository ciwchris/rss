It allows you to validate the test configuration, understand the application behavior under load, and troubleshoot any issues that arise. Today, we are excited to introduce Debug mode in Azure Load Testing, which enables running low scale test runs with better debuggability and enhanced logging.
 
Why Debug Mode?
Debug mode is designed to help you validate your test configuration and application behavior by running a load test with a single engine for up to 10 minutes. It provides debug logs for the test script, and request and response data for every failed request during the test run. This mode is powerful for troubleshooting issues with your test plan configura…]]></summary>

Why we use it
An increasing number of security vulnerabilities are caused by sensitive information in the source code being leaked or accidentally uploaded to open repositories GitHub, leading to the exposure of a large amount of user privacy. This information includes, but is not limited to, database credentials, app keys, etc. Traditional MySQL databases use usernames and passwords for login operations, naturally leading to the inclusion of these credentials in project configuration files. Even with proper safeguards, there remain unpredictable risks, such as hacking.
 
This tutorial will introduce how to integrate Microsoft Entra with Azure Database for MySQL to avoid using fixed usernames and passwords. By utilizing system-ass…]]></summary>

Note: For the purpose of this article, I'm going to use Entra ID to refer to a user identity, as well as a managed identity such as a service principal, as the approach is the same in this context here.
The above linked documentation covers how you would setup the Azure resource with Entra ID as the authentication mode, so I won't go over that here (also, you can configure that when you initial create the database, or using a Bicep script), instead I want to look at how we use that in a .NET application, because when you're connecting using Entra ID you don't have a pas…]]></summary>

For example, I recently learned about the availability of mortgage discounts

not buying a house, but
nevertheless, these were numbers from multiple sources that could be charted

We have seen that before load testing these endpoints, most users generate an access token and store it in the Azure Key Vault.

Sometime has elapsed between the act of storing the token in the key vault and the start of execution of the test. There can be a case where the token might expire during the test run and the request at the endpoints start throwing errors.

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that lets you test the performance and scalability of your web applications and APIs. You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.
Response time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining …]]></summary>

Users are required to manually configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID or Managed Identities so their AKS workloads can securely access these protected resources.
The Service Connector integration greatly simplifies the connection configuration experience for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. Service Connector takes care of authentication and network configurations securely and follows Azure best practices, so you can focus on your application code without worrying about your infrastructure connectivity.

Service Connector Action Breakdown
 
Before, in order to connect from AKS pods to a private Azure backing services using workload identity, users needed to perform the following actions manually:

Create a managed identity
Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL
Create Kubernetes service account
Establish federated identity credential trust
Grant permissions to access Azure Services
Deploy the application

Now, Service Connector performs steps 2 to 5 automatically. Additionally, for Azure services without public access, Service Connector creates private connection components such as private link, private endpoint, DNS record,
You can create a connection in the Service Connection blade within AKS.

 
Click create and select the target service, authentication method, and networking rule. The connection will then be automatically set up. Here are a few helpful links to for you to learn more about Service Connector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) is an open-source, lightweight component that allows users to autoscale container workloads on events in external scalers. KEDA extends the functionality of the native Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with a wide variety of scalers and scale-to-zero capabilities, thus allowing user applications to meet demand in a more sustainable and cost-efficient manner.
 
Today, we are excited to announce that the Azure Portal now supports KEDA scaling on memory, CPU, cron and Azure Service Bus scalers. Users will be able to easily create scaled objects and monitor their scaled objects and jobs all within the Portal interface, and for Azure Service Bus, Portal will handle the deployment and configuration of workload identity.

At last year's KubeCon North America, Microsoft announced the adoption of Karpenter in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an alternative to the Cluster Autoscaler (CA), referred to as Node Autoprovisioning (NAP). While Cluster Autoscaler has been the default node scaler in AKS/Kubernetes, there have been significant challenges that led to the adoption of Karpenter. This post delves into these challenges and explores how Karpenter addresses them.
Challenges with Cluster Autoscaler
Here is Node Autosclaing flow chart for Cluster-Autoscaler

App Spaces is a new way to look at building an application in Azure.  App Spaces is different because it’s not a service on its own, but rather an aggregation of existing Azure services with a simplified interface to make it easier to build and manage your web application.  It’s meant to reduce the confusion about which services to use and how to integrate them together end-to-end via a new visual designer. 
 

 
Building an End-to-End Todo App
Does a simple Todo app need 3-tiers (Front-end, backend, and database) with Google authentication and authorization?  Of course not!

CI/CD is a system that automates steps in software delivery. For WordPress developers, it means less manual work: once you push updates, the system automatically tests and deploys them. It's like having a assistant that not only speeds up your work but also checks for errors with each update, ensuring your WordPress site runs smoothly. This constant testing and feedback loop means you can fix bugs quickly and improve your site continuously without disrupting the live version. In short, CI/CD makes your development process faster, more efficient, and less error prone.

A staging site, also called as a development site, testing site, or sandbox – is a clone of your actual WordPress website which cannot be accessed by your visitors. This can only be accessed by people who have the staging URL.
 
Why do you need a staging site for your WordPress website?
A staging site is extremely useful when you are working on a WordPress website. It provides a safe area for development, testing, and experimentation. When you are trying out a new plugin, theme or custom code, there are chances that the website might break leading to downtime for your users, or even cause irreparable damage to your website like loss of content and data.

When you build applications that run code or commands from untrusted sources, you must ensure that the code runs in its own isolated environment. Dynamic sessions provide secure, ephemeral sandboxes called "sessions" for running potentially malicious code. Each session runs in its own Hyper-V virtualization boundary — ensuring complete isolation from other sessions and resources.

GPT-4o integrated in Kagi Assistant
We've benchmarked OpenAI's new flagship model GPT-4o, released yesterday, and its performance on our internal independent tests (Chess puzzles and Pyllms) is impressive. As a result, GPT-4o has now been used across various features in Assistant:

Default model for Research Expert mode and Code assistant



Used for interpreting and working with uploaded files, including images



Available through Chat Assistant

Note: Kagi Assistant is available as open beta for Ultimate plan members
Recipe summarizer
Kagi Universal Summarizer now automatically identifies when you are summarizing a recipe and conveniently displays both the ingredients and the cooking steps #3937 @leopoldarrestrom
You can use Kagi Summarizer as a standalone Web app, through Kagi Search Extension in your browser or directly in search results.




Additional notes for Family / Team account members
When setting up a Family or Team account, you now have the ability to add names for each member. This feature is particularly useful for managing team members who use email aliases #2695 @Alligator


Improvements and bug fixes
Wikipedia card links do not work with smaller browser windows #3469 @yeri
Time in Portugal throws a NaN error #3986 @bleveck
Wikipedia widget does not appear, even though there are relevant Wikipedia articles as search results. #394 @iiv
Sorry, I couldn't summarize these results. #3992 @sjdonadoo
Summarizer layout issue for “Dutch” language #3572 @Nyaa
Clickable Phone Number Results #3884 @kaidea
New assistant icon is off-centred  #3994 @sefidel
Assistant messages can go off the screen #4026 @Zambyte

If your Azure account does not have sufficient AAD (i.e., of Microsoft Entra) permissions, you will be unable to swiftly create easy auth in a web app. This article serves as a simple guide to walk you through the process of setting up easy authentication for your web app.

 
 
Step 1: Create a Web App
You may choose any combination of region/sku/stack/OS, as it does not affect the overall process.

After this step, we will obtain a callback URL for use in the next step, with the following format:
