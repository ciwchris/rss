        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[React is the most popular framework for frontend web applications, and Azure Static Web Apps is the best place to host these applications on Azure. With Azure Static Web Apps’ built-in managed Azure Functions, you can build and host a full-stack web application using only Azure Static Web Apps (and there’s a free plan!). In this article, we’ll detail the steps to build out a full-stack React application with backend Functions that can access databases or backend APIs (GitHub repo).

Starting from March 26th, we will begin including localized sales tax for all new customers who subscribe on or after this date.
April 9th, all existing customers who qualify for sales tax/VAT will see localized sales tax/VAT added to their monthly invoice in USD, on top of their current subscription fee. This adjustment will appear on your next invoice on or after April 9th, with no immediate extra charge.
 

If you are paying with an alternative method via Paypal, OpenNode, or any other non-Stripe provider: You will be prompted to pick a sales tax region the next time you go to purchase credit.
Discord or at support@kagi.com. We will be building an F.A.Q. page to answer any questions about the migration process.
To clarify, it means an end-price increase for affected members (sales tax/VAT will be automatically added on top of Kagi price, if applicable in your country/state) and this is mandated by Kagi becoming large enough to have legal sales tax/VAT obligation. In addition, Kagi will have to retroactively pay for all sales tax/VAT that we did not collect in the last almost two years. We have chosen to absorb this on behalf of our customers.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice, or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…]]></summary>

This method enhances security by avoiding the need to store credentials in code or configuration files. If you are interested in connecting to an Azure SQL database from a Python Function App using managed identity, you can find a related post here.
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets, keys, and certificates. With managed identities for Azure resources, you can authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication without needing credentials in your code.
Let's dive into the steps to achieve this with a Python App Service.

Azure Container Apps (ACA) provides a flexible and scalable platform for deploying containerized applications. One powerful feature it offers is the ability to customize startup commands and override default CMD or ENTRYPOINT defined in a Dockerfile. In this blog, we'll explore how to leverage the "Command Override" option using various methods in ACA and Container App Jobs.
 
Understanding Command Overrides
Command overrides come in handy when you need to execute specific CMD or change the ENTRYPOINT of your container at runtime.
 
Example:
If one wants to run "index.js" during the start of the app, but as per line number 14 in below image, the "server.js" file will execute.

It can be achieved by providing "node", "index.js" to Command Override field in ACA, in easy words, t…]]></summary>

JavaScript, the powerhouse behind many applications, sometimes faces limitations when it comes to memory in a Node.js environment.  Today, let's dive into a common challenge faced by many applications - the default memory limit in Node.js. In this blog post, we'll explore how to break free from these limitations, boost your application's performance, and optimize memory usage.
 

 
Understanding the Challenge:
 
Node.js applications are confined by a default memory limit set by the runtime environment. This can be a bottleneck for memory-intensive applications. Fortunately, Node.js provides a solution by allowing developers to increase this fixed memory limit, paving the way for improved performance.

moved to the mkinitcpio upstream project. The hooks are: systemd, udev, encrypt,
sd-encrypt, lvm2 and mdadm_udev.
To ensure no breakage of users' setup occurs, temporary
conflicts have been introduced into the respective packages to prevent installing packages
that are no longer compatible.
The following packages needs to be upgraded together:
mkinitcpio 38-3
systemd 255.4-2
lvm2 2.03.23-3
mdadm 4.3-2
cryptsetup 2.7.0-3
Please note that the mkinitcpio flag --microcode, and the microcode option in the preset files,  has been deprecated in favour of
a new microcode hook. This also allows you to drop the microcode initrd
lines from your boot configuration as they are now packed together with the main initramfs image.]]></summary>

This process brings simplicity, consistency, and a better mechanism to govern IT policies when deploying Java apps to the cloud. We’re now enhancing the build process with two new features: Tomcat and build environment variable support.
 
Tomcat is one of the most popular and widely used Java web servers, providing a fast and reliable platform for running Java applications on the web. By supporting Tomcat in the cloud build process, we make it easy for developers to migrate their existing Java web applications to Azure Container Apps without changing any code or configuration.

By default, HTTP apps in Azure Container Apps are accessible via a public URL that is unique to the app. However, you can create a container app to use a reverse proxy like NGINX to control how traffic is routed to multiple apps based on the path or hostname.
 
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Azure Container Apps to configure path and hostname-based routing for a set of containerized applications using NGINX as a reverse proxy. You'll deploy 4 applications: 1 NGINX container which will be publicly exposed and 3 container apps which will only be accessible from within the environment and that traffic will…]]></summary>

Put The Shine On by CocoRosie

I’ve been listening to this new-to-me CocoRosie
album. I fear that this is millenial music through

and their sound is almost an in-joke. But, like the rest of
their albums, this one has a few genuine bangers.

It supports a range of communication patterns, such as queues, topics, and event hubs, and enables reliable and secure message delivery at scale.
However, to ensure that your Azure Service Bus solution can handle the expected load and performance requirements, you need to conduct load testing and measure the throughput, latency, and resource utilization of your system under various scenarios.

However, when you have dependencies on public content you can introduce security and reliability risks into your environment. In this blog, we will describe the best practices for mitigating risks when using public content from Docker Hub and other public registries.
 
Import public content locally whenever possible
Importing public content to an internal registry is the first step in a set of best practices for your software supply chain . Doing so raises the availability and reliability of your public content pipeline. If you pull public content without using credentials from any public registry, including Docker Hub, you may be limited in…]]></summary>

How do you manage the lifecycle of those APIs?
What governance would you apply to these APIs?
What is the list of environments needed to manage these APIs?
What are the deployment strategies for those APIs?
How would you integrate those APIs with other services?

 
As your company's number of APIs increases, so does the complexity of managing them. Azure API Center (APIC) is a central repository for your APIs lifecycle management, and it offers the more efficient ways for management. Throughout this post, I will take a first look at what Azure API Center is and what it offers.
