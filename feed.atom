        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following on from my previous blog post covering SSL Termination and NGINX, in this post we will expand our deployment to also now include user authentication of a new web app.
 
As with every article in this series this has been driven by customer use cases. In this instance the customer desired having a development web application on a public domain but ring fenced to only allow access to authenticated users from Azure AD.
 
Before we dive deeper into the use case and implementation its important to understand the various components if unfamiliar. I will speak about benefits of certain technologies as I go through but it is worth taking a quick look at these links as a level set if you need it:

I have decided to create a series of blogs covering some of the common ways to increase cluster security. I have plans for blog posts regarding Azure AD user authentication on micro services, utilizing Open Service Mesh and Network Policies to implement internal cluster networking security and the different options regarding metrics, alerting and telemetry for AKS clusters.
 
Today however I will start by discussing using Azure Front Door, Private Link Service and NGINX Ingress Controller to create a secure ingress to private back end services with SSL termination.

        <link href="https://archlinux.org/news/git-migration-announcement/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-15T19:50:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Friday morning (2023-05-19) the Git packaging migration will start until Sunday (2023-05-21). The Arch Linux packaging team will not be able to update packages in any of the repositories during this period.
Notification when the migration starts, and when it is completed, will be published on the [arch-dev-public] mailing list.
How does this impact Arch Linux users?
The [testing] repository will be split into [core-testing] and [extra-testing], the [staging] repository will be split into [core-staging] and [extra-staging]. The [community] repository will be merged into [extra] and will therefore be empty after the migration.
All affected repositories will be provided as empty repositories for a transition period after the migration. For regular users, this means that everything works as before.
Note: After the migration is done, users that have the testing repositories enabled need to include the new repositories ([core-testing] and [extra-testing] instead of [testing]) in their pacman.conf before updating their system.
Other changes:
SVN access is discontinued and will dissappear.
The svn2git mirror will no longer be updated.
asp, which relies on the svn2git mirror, will stop working. It is replaced by pkgctl repo clone.
How does this impact Arch Linux tier 1 mirrors?
During the migration rsync and HTTP access will be shut down. We will send an email notification to arch-mirrors once everything has been finished.
How does this impact Arch Linux packagers?
Packagers will not be able to patch and update their packages. The internal Tier 0 mirror is also going to be disabled for the duration of this migration.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Container Apps is a fully managed environment that enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. When you host your apps or microservices in Azure Container Apps, you may not always want to publish them directly to the internet. Instead, you may want to expose them through a reverse proxy, a content delivery network (CDN) or any other similar device.
 
Azure Front Door is Microsoft’s modern cloud Content Delivery Network (CDN) that can help you deliver higher availability, lower latency, greater scale, and more secure experiences to your users accessing your container apps.

The worker instances of customer sites are virtual machines running server OS. The VMs and their host servers are upgraded regularly to keep them secure and healthy.
A well-designed upgrade process can keep customer sites high available through maintenance. IaaS and PaaS take different processes.
 
The Upgrade Process in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS provides virtual machines to cloud customers. Cloud customers manage the software environment of their VMs.
IaaS uses the following process to upgrade the host environment of a virtual machine.

$privateEndpoints = Get-AzPrivateEndpoint

How To Enable Network Security Group for Private Endpoints 
By default, network policies are disabled for a subnet in a virtual network.
You need to assign the NSG name first in this subnet, then enable NSG in “Network Policy for Private Endpoint”, then the PE will be applied the NSG rule.

Suggestions for Using Custom DNS.


Set up less than 3 custom DNS servers. 


         Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses the CoreDNS project for cluster DNS management and resolution. Based on observation, it only takes the first three custom DNS server settings. If you specify more than three custom DNS servers, AKS will only use the first three.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the month of May, we’re focusing on cloud native—a modern approach to development that leverages cloud technologies, like containers and microservices. By design, cloud-native applications offer many advantages, including easier scalability, improved resiliency, and simpler management. While it might sound like a major shift, adopting a cloud native strategy is easier and quicker than you might think.
 
To help you get started, we’ve gathered essential learning to help you embrace a cloud native approach. Learn the fundamentals, explore tools, work through guided samples, and join a live webinar to learn more about cloud native apps.

Having the ability to identify clear root cause for incidents in production workloads is valuable, the best way to prevent future incidents is to understand what caused past ones. Of course you can have a good set of load tests but still, incidents in production environments can happen and it's crucial to have available data that can help to understand what happened so application can be improved and prevent replications.
In this article we will learn how to use Application Insights and automatic profiler to find root cause for past incidents and prepare logging platform to ensure meaningful data for analysis.

Step 1:
Go to >App Service Logs> Enable Application Logging (Blob) and select the desired Blob Storage and the Container and select the Level of logging.
 

 
For more information on different types of logs you can refer this document.
 
Step 2:
Below is the code we have deployed a .Net Core MVC web application in a Windows App Service.
 
 
 public IActionResult Index()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("This is a test to send logs to : Blob ");

            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }
 
 
Below are different level of logs details which you can log:
 

 




Note: If you write logs to blobs, the retention policy no longer applies if you delete the app but keep the logs in the blobs. For more information, see Costs that might accrue after resource deletion.




 
Step 3:
Go to Storage Account> Container and select the folder with your app service name and download the ( .txt ) file to check the logs.
 

 
The Blob option also includes additional information in the log messages, such as the ID of the origin VM instance of the log message (InstanceId), thread ID (Tid), and a more granular timestamp (EventTickCount) in a ( .csv ) file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern applications are typically architected as distributed collections of microservices, with each collection of microservices performing some discrete business function. This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice. Or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…]]></summary>
