Throughout this post, I'm going to walk through how we migrate our existing ASP.NET application to the Azure App Service instance with minimal code changes.
 
What needs to consider for changes?
 
I'm more than confident to migrate our existing ASP.NET application to Azure App Service with no changes because that's what Azure App Service is designed for. However, there are a few things to change due to the cloud-native characteristics of Azure App Service. Then, what are they?

Customers may want to list all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoints, and enable Network Security Group for the Private Endpoints.
There is no way to do it from Azure portal. But the below Power shell script can help customers list all the subnets used for Private Endpoints.
 

List all VNET subnets used for Private Endpoint using PowerShell script

$privateEndpoints = Get-AzPrivateEndpoint
$subnetIds = $privateEndpoints | ForEach-Object { $_.Subnet.Id }

How To Enable Network Security Group for Private Endpoints 
By default, network policies are disabled for a subnet in a virtual network.
You need to assign the NSG name first in this subnet, then enable NSG in “Network Policy for Private Endpoint”, then the PE will be applied the NSG rule.

Suggestions for Using Custom DNS.


Set up less than 3 custom DNS servers. 


         Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses the CoreDNS project for cluster DNS management and resolution. Based on observation, it only takes the first three custom DNS server settings. If you specify more than three custom DNS servers, AKS will only use the first three.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service web app. The primary aim of this blog is to guide one step-by-step to add instrumentation to your application, as well as how to access the information logged.
 
Step 1:
Go to >App Service Logs> Enable Application Logging (Blob) and select the desired Blob Storage and the Container and select the Level of logging.
 

 
For more information on different types of logs you can refer this document.
 
Step 2:
Below is the code we have deployed a .Net Core MVC web application in a Windows App Service.
 
 
 public IActionResult Index()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("This is a test to send logs to : Blob ");

            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }
 
 
Below are different level of logs details which you can log:
 

 




Note: If you write logs to blobs, the retention policy no longer applies if you delete the app but keep the logs in the blobs. For more information, see Costs that might accrue after resource deletion.




 
Step 3:
Go to Storage Account> Container and select the folder with your app service name and download the ( .txt ) file to check the logs.
 

 
The Blob option also includes additional information in the log messages, such as the ID of the origin VM instance of the log message (InstanceId), thread ID (Tid), and a more granular timestamp (EventTickCount) in a ( .csv ) file.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice. Or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workload Identity is an open-source project that enables Federated Identity in Kubernetes clusters. It is the next evolution of a public preview feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), that is built on the now deprecated pod identity project. Azure AD Workload Identity, is simpler to use and replaces pod identity. Azure AD Workload Identity on AKS is now generally available so customers can run production workloads using Workload Identity on both Windows and Linux and migrate applications using Pod Identity over to Workload Identity. 
 
Azure AD Workload Identity leverages Service Account Token Volume Projection giving pods the ability to use a Kubernetes identity (service account), to which a Kubernetes token is issued and OIDC federation which enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory based on annotated service accounts.
 
Since the open-source pod identity project is now deprecated, AKS will continue to support the AKS pod identity through 2023. To ease the transition, customers can run Pod Identity and Workload Identity in parallel on an existing AKS cluster.  Please note that during the Public Preview we enabled the sidecar to give customers time to update their SDKs, but this is not a supported configuration for General Availability. We recommend that customers update applications to a list of supported SDKs that will allow applications to talk to the AAD endpoint.]]></summary>

With workloads configured to consume only the necessary resources and dynamically scale to meet demand, businesses can optimize resource usage while reducing downtime. Additionally, Kubernetes allows organizations to deploy multiple applications from various teams or business units to a single cluster, resulting in significantly reduced infrastructure costs. However, this multitenancy approach poses a new challenge.
 
Consider this scenario: your cluster generates $100/day in infrastructure spend with a shared set of resources split across 10 developer teams. If 1 team consumes 80% of the cluster’s resources, it does not make sense to split infrastructure costs evenly across all teams at $10/day. Instead, your organ…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service app. You can send your logs from your App Service to Storage Accounts, Event Hubs, or Log Analytics.
 
This blog will guide you step-by-step to enable AppServiceHTTPLogs , AppServiceAppLogs and view them in Log Analytics.
 
Step 1:
Go to Azure Portal > App Service > Diagnostic Settings and enable the required settings you would like to send to the destination . In this blog I have taken an example of HTTP Logs and App Service Application Logs in a Windows App Service ( .Net Core ).
 

 
You can refer this doc for more details on supported log types.
 
Step 2:
In your application code you can use the usual logging options and send log messages to application logs. By default, ASP.NET Core uses the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices logging provider. For more information, see ASP.NET Core logging in Azure.
 
Below is the code snippet of the logging I am doing in my .Net Core MVC webapp.
 

 
 
Step 3:
Go to Azure Portal > Log Analytics workspace > Logs and query the AppServiceAppLogs table and you can see the logs being sent. You can use different levels of logging such as Error, Information, Verbose and etc. in your application and this will show up in your logs in Log Analytics under the “Level” field. You can filter out logs based on the level:
 

 
Similarly, you can also query AppServiceHTTPLogs:
 

 
Sample Queries in Log Analytics:
 




AppServiceAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated >ago(10m)
 
AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where TimeGenerated >ago(10m)




 
 
More information:

AppServiceAppLogs is now available for ASP .NET apps on Windows - Azure App Service

Therefore, they usually enable private endpoint as well as configure Access Restriction to deny all the public traffic.
 
When the private endpoint is enabled and public traffic is denied to the web app, all the public traffic to this app is cut off. Since there is a range of IP addresses where agents are deployed, they have a public IP. Obviously, these agents are unable to reach web app.

 
As a solution, we can either allow the IP ranges list in the firewall or use self-hosted agents to deploy.

I don’t think it’ll become generalized AI - I think the AI winter cycle is the base case and human-like intelligence is qualitatively different than LLM, no matter how many terabytes of training data you throw at them. But that isn’t what this article is about.
No, it’s about other stuff, particularly technological change, happiness, and craft.


Optimists and pessimists agree that AI will change the world.

You can implement the server thumbprint in the .NET application code to resolve “Remote certificate is invalid” when multi-tenant web app is configured as client in client-server model and making HTTS request to a server configured with a private CA.
 
When a web app acts as a client and makes an HTTPS call to an external server secured by a private CA, the web app uses its default installed trusted root CA’s public key to validate the server’s certificate. However, the remote server certificate is signed by a private CA, and since there is no such trusted CA in the web app’s trusted source list, it will not be validated by the web app. You cannot modify th…]]></summary>
