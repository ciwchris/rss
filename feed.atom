One of them is that you are asked to generate the OpenAPI document from the function app right after the build and integrate it with Power Platform or Azure API Management. What if you want to do this process within your CI/CD pipeline?
 
Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to generate the OpenAPI document within the GitHub Actions workflow right after the function app build.
 

NOTE: Let's use the sample app provided by the Azure Functions OpenAPI Extension repository.

 
First of all, you need to install the Azure Functions Core Tools within your GitHub Actions workflow. Installing the tool varies depending on the runner OS. The command…]]></summary>

Unlike Windows App Service, it used to be difficult for App Service on Linux users to make an SSH connection to the intended instance. You might need to handle Session affinity cookie (ARR cookie) or clean up cookies to allow KUDU to randomly choose an instance to attach.

It was thoroughly refreshing. I’ve been spending far too much time building a startup, reading about startups, being in the loop. My friends will tell me about an eight million dollar funding round and I’ll say “oh, that little, for a 2022 Series A?” I need perspective, a break, a breath of fresh air.
The thing about IndieWeb is that it’s still a place where people and ideas matter. You can have a whole conversation without mentioning money or a business plan. IndieWeb is about owning your own small parcel of internet-land and farming it with your own hands. Much like sharecropping, it isn’t ethically pure.

For many years, scientists have assumed that the loss of connections between brain cells caused Alzheimer's-related symptoms, including memory loss, but actual evidence of the role of synaptic loss had been limited to a small number of brain biopsies and post-mortem brain exams conducted on patients with moderate or advanced disease. However, the emergence of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning technology has allowed researchers to observe the loss of synapses in living patients with even mild symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.]]></summary>

When we launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019, we set out to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we’ve had the opportunity to work with many customers to help them adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, Kroger, Liantis, Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley’s, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.

For the post, we'll use the Apollo Server and Azure Static Web Apps for hosting the API, mainly because SWA provides security (and if you're wondering, this is how I came across the need to write this recent post).
If you're new to GraphQL on Azure, I'd encourage you to check out part 3 in which I go over how we can create a GraphQL server using Apollo and deploy that to an Azure Function, which is the process we'll be using for this post.

This npm package works conceptually similar to the .NET one in that you annotate the Function handler to provide OpenAPI schema information. This is done using a wrapper, or higher order, function, which takes a JavaScript object in that represents the schema for OpenAPI.

At Ignite, we announced Azure Container Apps, a serverless application-centric hosting service that enables users to quickly deploy containerized applications and microservices to Azure without the need to configure and manage underlying infrastructure resources or container orchestrators. Azure Container Apps runs on  Azure Kubernetes Service, and includes several open-source projects: Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA), Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), and Envoy. This open-source foundation enables teams to build and run portable applications powered by Kubernetes and open standards without the operational overhead and management complexity of working with the platform directly.

Azure PowerShell is a set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line. Azure PowerShell is designed to make it easy to learn and get started with, but provides powerful features for automation.
 
Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications.

This article only discuss the Windows Azure App Service, Linux App Service is out of scope of this article. 

 
What happened? 

The Windows Azure App Service platform removed some minor NodeJS version. That could result in some un-expected result if the App Service's configuration is not right. 

 
Is that removement is expected behavior? 

Yes.
Azure App Service is a PaaS service, and the platform will manage the Windows Node version.

in January, and it radically reshaped my conception of local
politics and the general arc of city politics in the last 50 years.
Highly, highly recommended stuff.

Brian Lovin did a design crit of Placemark,
which has been powering a big burst of activity on that front.
The energy on Placemark is happening in two semi-parallel efforts:
knocking out the last few core concepts - layers and properties, mostly -
and running through this new, super-helpful list of ideas and
critiques from Brian. The last few days have been super, super
productive as a result, to the extent that I’ll probably crash
and take a few days off in a little bit. But for now, I’ve
got energy and direction, and I’ve got to ride it.

Reading
This paper on Ethnographic Research on Dynamicland
resonated with me. You can read a lot about the technology
and business of these sorts of efforts, but rarely is there
someone looking for the human interactions, and Dynamicland
is one of the most unusual and ambitious projects out there.
Bachmann doesn’t editorialize much, but I think some
themes emerge, like the tension between “brainstorming”/collaboration versus
authority and vision.
It reminded me of The Idea Factory,
that great book about Bell Labs. Research labs are this odd thing -
part of what made Bell Labs great was the ability to work on a slightly
longer timeline, with fewer limitations on what you created. But
that ability was directly a result of the government’s explicit
permittance of AT&T Bell as a monopoly, during that period of time.
Listening
Townes Van Zandt by Townes Van Zandt

Been on a Townes Van Zandt kick recently, sparked of course
by seeing If I Needed You
pop up in an episode of Patriot.


Almost every time I’m very productive, it coincides with a full listen-through
of the whole Joanna Newsom ouvre. There’s nothing like it.]]></summary>
