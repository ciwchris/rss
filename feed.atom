Frontend frameworks have evolved to make use of the server to provide optimal hosting for frontend applications. From hybrid rendering modes to API routes and backend-for-frontend patterns, frontend frameworks such as Next.js, Nuxt.js, SvelteKit, and others have become capable of building full-stack applications. With Azure Static Web Apps, you can host these frontend frameworks on our distributed static asset host and serverless managed functions, providing you with the best experience for hosting frontend web applications on Azure.

Starting from March 26th, we will begin including localized sales tax for all new customers who subscribe on or after this date.
April 9th, all existing customers who qualify for sales tax/VAT will see localized sales tax/VAT added to their monthly invoice in USD, on top of their current subscription fee. This adjustment will appear on your next invoice on or after April 9th, with no immediate extra charge.
 

If you are paying with an alternative method via Paypal, OpenNode, or any other non-Stripe provider: You will be prompted to pick a sales tax region the next time you go to purchase credit.
Discord or at support@kagi.com. We will be building an F.A.Q. page to answer any questions about the migration process.
To clarify, it means an end-price increase for affected members (sales tax/VAT will be automatically added on top of Kagi price, if applicable in your country/state) and this is mandated by Kagi becoming large enough to have legal sales tax/VAT obligation. In addition, Kagi will have to retroactively pay for all sales tax/VAT that we did not collect in the last almost two years. We have chosen to absorb this on behalf of our customers.

However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice, or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…]]></summary>

Understanding Command Overrides
Command overrides come in handy when you need to execute specific CMD or change the ENTRYPOINT of your container at runtime.
 
Example:
If one wants to run "index.js" during the start of the app, but as per line number 14 in below image, the "server.js" file will execute.

Part two is here Part 2  .In this third part we’ll continue from where we left off and set up cert manager, create a CA issuer, upgrade our ingress routes, register our app, and create secrets and a cookie for authentication. You can also refer to the official documentation here for some of the steps TLS with an ingress controller.

In the previous post we uploaded cert manager images to our ACR. Now lets install the cert manager images by running the following:

JavaScript, the powerhouse behind many applications, sometimes faces limitations when it comes to memory in a Node.js environment.  Today, let's dive into a common challenge faced by many applications - the default memory limit in Node.js. In this blog post, we'll explore how to break free from these limitations, boost your application's performance, and optimize memory usage.
 

 
Understanding the Challenge:
 
Node.js applications are confined by a default memory limit set by the runtime environment. This can be a bottleneck for memory-intensive applications. Fortunately, Node.js provides a solution by allowing developers to increase this fixed memory limit, paving the way for improved performance.

moved to the mkinitcpio upstream project. The hooks are: systemd, udev, encrypt,
sd-encrypt, lvm2 and mdadm_udev.
To ensure no breakage of users' setup occurs, temporary
conflicts have been introduced into the respective packages to prevent installing packages
that are no longer compatible.
The following packages needs to be upgraded together:
mkinitcpio 38-3
systemd 255.4-2
lvm2 2.03.23-3
mdadm 4.3-2
cryptsetup 2.7.0-3
Please note that the mkinitcpio flag --microcode, and the microcode option in the preset files,  has been deprecated in favour of
a new microcode hook. This also allows you to drop the microcode initrd
lines from your boot configuration as they are now packed together with the main initramfs image.]]></summary>

This process brings simplicity, consistency, and a better mechanism to govern IT policies when deploying Java apps to the cloud. We’re now enhancing the build process with two new features: Tomcat and build environment variable support.
 
Tomcat is one of the most popular and widely used Java web servers, providing a fast and reliable platform for running Java applications on the web. By supporting Tomcat in the cloud build process, we make it easy for developers to migrate their existing Java web applications to Azure Container Apps without changing any code or configuration.
 
Build environment variables are variables that affect how the build process is executed. You can use them to specify the v…]]></summary>

By default, HTTP apps in Azure Container Apps are accessible via a public URL that is unique to the app. However, you can create a container app to use a reverse proxy like NGINX to control how traffic is routed to multiple apps based on the path or hostname.
 
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Azure Container Apps to configure path and hostname-based routing for a set of containerized applications using NGINX as a reverse proxy. You'll deploy 4 applications: 1 NGINX container which will be publicly exposed and 3 container apps which will only be accessible from within the environment and that traffic will…]]></summary>
