You can secure communications end-to-end or terminate transport-level security at any communication point for Spring Boot apps. You can also automate the provisioning and configuration for all the Azure resources needed for securing communications.
 
Implementing secure communications as part of your solution architecture can be challenging. Many customers manually rotate their certificates or create their own solutions to automate provisioning and configuration. Even then, there is still data exfiltration risk – say unauthorized copying or transfer of data from server systems. With Azure Spring Cloud, all of this is handled …]]></summary>

These so-called 'epigenetic clocks' have proved to be better predictors of lifespan and health than chronological age. In a new study, Yale researchers used one such clock, appropriately named "GrimAge," to ask two questions: How much does chronic stress accelerate that biological clock?

The idea of freely sharing creative works, to be recombined by a community, was exhilarating: I would contribute raw materials to the collective - photographs, code, writing - and recombine the works of others, in Photoshop competitions or remixes. Practically every photo I’d license as CC-BY-SA. If someone used one of my photos in their blog, I felt a little jolt of approval and recognition. It felt cool.
The same went for open source. The early communities around Drupal and Node.js were radically open source. Companies were releasing their entire products for free and writing detailed blog posts about how they figured out hard problems. Whatever trade secrets they had wer…]]></summary>

But, compared to Azure DevOps, there are many spaces to achieve the same efficiency level as Azure DevOps. GitHub Actions has recently released a new feature called "Reusable Workflows", which you can reduce the refactoring concerns. Throughout this post, I'm going to refactor the existing Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD pipeline workflows, using the "reusable workflows" feature of GitHub Actions.
 
Workflow for Azure Static Web Apps
 
While provisioning an Azure Static Web Apps (ASWA) instance, GitHub Actions workflow is automatically generated by default. Here's a sample workflow. I'm pretty sure it's not that different from yours.

I’m spending a week in Germany. So far, I’ve visited the one and only Zeppelin Museum and a castle. Technically I’ve been trying to make this an unplugged vacation, so this will be short.
The traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because the market is “efficient” (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.
Coase noted, however, that there are a number of transaction costs to using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is actually more than just the price of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentia…]]></summary>

Kubernetes has become a platform of choice for building cloud native applications. Kubernetes is highly scalable, highly available, and easy to use, and has many other advantages that make it an excellent choice for building distributed applications.
 
However, its distributed nature means monitoring everything that is happening within the cluster can be a challenge. Prometheus and Grafana make our experience better.
 
In this article, we will set up a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and deploy Prometheus and Grafana to gather monitoring data and visualize them.
 
Understand the tooling
 
Prometheus is an open source project that was originally created at SoundCloud in 2012, and contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Services currently provides two workflows for scaling: scale up and scale out.

Scale up: Get more CPU, memory, disk space, and extra features. You scale up by changing the pricing tier of the App Service plan that your app belongs to.
Scale out: Increase the number of VM instances that run your app. You can scale out to as many as 30 instances, depending on your pricing tier. App Service Environments in Isolated tier further increases your scale-out count to 100 instances. You can scale manually or automatically based on predefined rules and schedules.

 
These existing scaling workflows work well, but you may want to instead have the App Service platform automatically scale your web app without the hassle of defining auto-scaling rules & schedules.

You don’t have to be cynical to ask “does this thing do what it says it does?” To want to actually install the software and confirm whether it’s a competitive market, an uncompetitive market, or not a market at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Docker usage has grown, Docker Compose has become the leader in running multi-service applications locally. Unfortunately, as your application expands and more services must communicate, we’ve found authoring these Compose files can become arduous, time consuming, and mistake prone. We want to make writing Compose files with volumes, ports, and multiple services much easier. 
 
Today, we’d like to announce the Docker Compose Language Service in the Docker Extension for VS Code. That’s right, the Docker Extension will now provide Docker Compose files with IntelliSense, Tooltips, and syntax validation. Here are a few of the incoming features in our 1.18 release: 
 

IntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)


 

Tooltips for Compose keywords (i.e. services, image) 



Right-click to format a Compose file (Shift + Alt + F) 
YAML Syntax Validation 
Hyperlinks for Docker Images 

In our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!
 
There are more improvements to come! Stay tuned for these features:

More tab completions
Docker Compose schema validation 
… and much more! 

We love your feedback! If you have any comments or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the Compose Language Service Repo or the VS Code Docker Repo for general feedback.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The researchers are now calling for these long-term health effects to be considered when young people and their families discuss treatment options with their healthcare team initially. The study found that people who survived cancer had five times as many GP or hospital visits relating to cardiovascular disease by age 45, as a matched control group of people who had not had cancer early in life. They also had much higher numbers of healthcare visits relating to infections, disorders of the immune system, and subsequent cancers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new study suggests that enlargement of stem cells contributes to age-related decline in function. The researchers found that blood stem cells, which are among the smallest cells in the body, lose their ability to perform their normal function -- replenishing the body's blood cells -- as they grow larger. When the cells were restored to their usual size, they behaved normally again.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chronic inflammation caused by obesity may trigger the development of cells that break down bone tissue, including the bone that holds teeth in place, according to new research that sought to improve understanding of the connection between obesity and gum disease. The study, completed in an animal model and published in October in the Journal of Dental Research, found that excessive inflammation resulting from obesity raises the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), a group of immune cells that increase during illness to regulate immune function. MDSCs, which originate in the bone marrow, develop into a range of different cell types, including osteoclasts (a cell that breaks down bone tissue).]]></summary>
