We have partnered with Brave Search to bring their search results into Kagi. Brave joins the growing list of Kagi's search sources, ensuring that if you can not find something on Kagi, it does not exist on the web. This will come at no additional cost to you, thanks to continuous optimizations in our search stack.



Kagi Assistant usage stats are now on the stats page. Assistant is still in beta and currently available to Ultimate plan users. We plan to roll it out to all members in January.  #2141 @Grooty



We vastly improved Image search results. Check them here including all the powerful filters.

By the numbers, 2023 was pretty normal: I read around 20 books, ran around 400 miles. It’s funny how the statistics even out to the same numbers when, during the year, I think I’m in a reading drought or, like several months this year, hadn’t run in weeks.
What was the best?

I think that the best book in general that I read was Achieving Our Country by Richard Rorty. I think I’ve been politically shifting for a while now – not to the left or the right, but around questions of reform versus radicalism, unification versus schism. Rorty isn’t the last word on the matter, but reading him was inspiring because it opened my eyes to the other possibilities of how t…]]></summary>

and they can’t, or they’ve bought a house. The desire to own ones own home is
almost universal in the people I know in the US. It’s even stronger for folks
who live outside of major cities. And people for whom the “security” part of
homeownership rings stronger - who grew up in instability or in countries where
physical goods are preferred to financial instruments for savings.
I don’t want to buy a house. Maybe I’ll need to, but I can’t help but think that
the milestone is vastly overrated in public imagination and there are problems
with it on a personal and societal level.

Houses are non-diversified, illiquid holdings that make up too large a

Durable Functions (DF) enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. 
 
There are two major changes introduced in this release: upgrading to the latest version of the Azure Storage SDK (a breaking change for .NET in-process apps) and the introduction of a new partition manager. We describe these and the motivation for each in the sections below. 
 
Please note: 

At this time, DF extension v3.0.0-rc.1 is only supported in the App Service Plan. Auto-scaling support for the Consumption and Elastic Premium plans will be announced later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers love containerization for its ability to ensure consistency, portability and manageability of their applications, while aligning with modern DevOps practices. Azure Container Apps is a great platform for running polyglot apps and containers of all kinds in Azure, as it abstracts away the complexity of managing underlying Kubernetes while providing unified networking, observability, and scaling for higher developer velocity. While it serves as a versatile container platform, it may not offer precise insights into your Java applications or the state of your Java execution environment (such as the JVM). To better cater to our Java-centric customers running containerized apps, we've recently initiated a new journey to enhance the Java developer experience on Azure Container Apps.

        <link href="https://archlinux.org/news/bugtracker-migration-to-gitlab-completed/"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that the migration of the bugtracker to GitLab is done! 🥳 
Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!
This means the issue tracker and merge requests on the GitLab package repos are now enabled.
The old bugtracker will subsequently be closed down. For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked Task #56716) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.
Packaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the "Add a new Bug" button on the package page on archlinux.org will automatically direct you to the correct place to open the issue. The workflow afterwards is mostly the same, first our Bug Wranglers will have a look at the issues and triage them, and then they will be handed over to the respective Package Maintainers to fix. A list of all issues can be found here.
If you do not have an account for GitLab already (which authenticates against our SSO service), please write us a mail with your desired username to accountsupport@archlinux.org as advised in the banner.]]></summary>
