        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My colleague David asked about a very interesting feature.
 

"What if we can provision Azure Static Web App and deploy the app at the same time? If we can, we just simply hand over our PoC repository to developers so that they just run it directly from there."

 
Although two challenges exist to achieve this idea, if we can combine both challenges, devs can autopilot everything from the resource creating to the app deployment, which will result in improving the development experiences. Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to offer the autopilot feature for your application repository.
 

You can download the sample code from this repository.

and am using to show some numbers and charts in my apartment
as ambient data. I think it’s pretty cool.

Alternative display hardware
I really like alternative display technology.
eInk displays,
unlit LEDs, like on my AlphaSmart,
or flip-disc displays,
vane displays,
split-flap displays - I wish
it was all more widespread. Sure, those flip board displays have
mechanical failures more often than traditional screens, but
they look and sound so nice.
Most alternative display technology is expensive and inconvenient,
especially when compared to the absolute marvel of supply-chain
efficiency that is modern traditional LED displays. You can buy
a decent 39” TV for a little over $200 today. A 31” eInk panel will run you
$1,500, and a fl…]]></summary>

Despite the sheer number of genes that each human cell contains, these so-called 'coding' DNA sequences comprise just 1% of our entire genome.

Files
The meaning and importance of the file has shifted a lot in the last
decade. The Verge wrote about how students today don’t have a grasp
on how files and folders work - or they have a very good understanding of the
norms of storing information in the cloud, but not on their local computers.
The web contains all sorts of things that we never think of or use as files:
is your email an Mbox file? Do you ever
directly use the HEIC files that
are the native format of Apple Photos? Or consider any rich text on the internet,
like a Notion page - does it have a defined file type and an option to download?

Usually that term refers to that person's emotional history, but in genetics and our genomes, 'extra baggage' can also describe the transposons lurking in our genomes, a historical record of our genomes surviving traumatic invasions during evolution. Transposons are repetitive DNA sequences that have the capability to move (transpose) from one location to another in the genome (an organism's complete set of genetic instructions) and are considered important invaders of our genomes during evolution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from two independent research teams have discovered how the mislocalization of a protein, known as TDP-43, alters the genetic instructions for UNC13A, providing a possible therapeutic target that could also have implications in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other forms of dementia. ALS and FTD are two neurodegenerative disorders in which many cases are linked by mislocalization of TDP-43, where instead of being primarily located in the nucleus of the cell where genes are activated, it forms aggregates outside the nucleus in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Rare mutations in the TDP-43 gene are known to cause ALS, but almost all cases of ALS show mislocalization of TDP-43.]]></summary>

One of them is that you are asked to generate the OpenAPI document from the function app right after the build and integrate it with Power Platform or Azure API Management. What if you want to do this process within your CI/CD pipeline?
 
Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to generate the OpenAPI document within the GitHub Actions workflow right after the function app build.
 

NOTE: Let's use the sample app provided by the Azure Functions OpenAPI Extension repository.

 
First of all, you need to install the Azure Functions Core Tools within your GitHub Actions workflow. Installing the tool varies depending on the runner OS. The command…]]></summary>

It was thoroughly refreshing. I’ve been spending far too much time building a startup, reading about startups, being in the loop.

The thing about IndieWeb is that it’s still a place where people and ideas matter. You can have a whole conversation without mentioning money or a business plan. IndieWeb is about owning your own small parcel of internet-land and farming it with your own hands. Much like sharecropping, it isn’t ethically pure. But it’s a heck of a lot nicer than than the world built on value extraction and exclusion.

For many years, scientists have assumed that the loss of connections between brain cells caused Alzheimer's-related symptoms, including memory loss, but actual evidence of the role of synaptic loss had been limited to a small number of brain biopsies and post-mortem brain exams conducted on patients with moderate or advanced disease. However, the emergence of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning technology has allowed researchers to observe the loss of synapses in living patients with even mild symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.]]></summary>

When we launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019, we set out to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we’ve had the opportunity to work with many customers to help them adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, Kroger, Liantis, Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley’s, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.
