If you are working with many App Service plans, managing the subnets can be an unnecessary administrative task. Therefore, I am happy to announce that we are introducing Multi-plan subnet join (MPSJ) in limited public preview at Ignite 2023.
 
MPSJ reduces subnet sprawl when dealing with many apps across many plans and simplifies management of networking control such as Network Security Groups and Route tables across App Service plans. With MPSJ you can join a virtual network/subnet in a different subscription, but all App Service plan joining a specific subnet must be in the same subscription.
 
You may still want to use individual subnets if you plan to differentiate on Network Security…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are introducing a change in JDK/JRE packages of our distro. This is
triggered from the way a JRE is build in modern versions of Java (>9). We are
introducing this change in Java 21.
To sum it up instead of having JDK and JRE packages coexist in the same system
we will be making them conflict. The JDK variant package includes the runtime
environment to execute Java applications so if one needs compilation and
runtime of Java they need only the JDK package in the future. If, on the other
hand, they need just runtime of Java then JRE (or jre-headless) will work.
This will (potentially) require a manual user action during upgrade:
If you have both JDK and JRE installed you can manually install the JDK
with pacman -Syu jdk-openjdk and this removes the JRE related packages.
If you have both JRE and JRE-headless you will need to choose one of
them and install it manually since they would conflict each other now.
If you only have one of the JDK/JRE/JRE-headless pacman should resolve
dependencies normally and no action is needed.
At the moment this is only valid for the upcoming JDK 21 release.]]></summary>

The network plugin determines how the pods and nodes communicate with each other and with external resources. 
Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on your requirements and preferences.
 
In this blog post, I will explain the differences between Kubenet and Azure CNI, and help you choose the best option for your AKS cluster.
 
Here is a short overview of the network plugin types available to Azure Kubernetes Service:

Really took advantage of the breadth of New York culture: I saw an opera at the Metropolitan Opera House, and then went to see prog-metal band Polyphia play guitar solos as fast as possible. At the latter, there were multiple mosh pits and the most packed audience I’ve ever encountered. It was my first ‘metal’ oriented concert, and the friendliness and openness of everyone who attended was remarkable.


Via Arts Gowanus, I saw lots of local art and was especially struck by Perrin Ireland’s art about animals, gender, and climate change.

It has been a slow, silly process in which I celebrate when a single
pixel lights up on the device. I’m not even writing firmware or code
that runs “on the device” - that’s a stretch goal for someday.
I’m just writing a Rust program that renders some WebP graphics and
pushes them to Tidbyt’s API.

I’ve had a lot of type 2 fun. I’ve also learned a lot more about Rust.
It’s probably not useful for many people, but
the repository is now open source.
There’s a little implementation of checking a Fastmail email
account to get a count of unread emails and Strava for new runs.
Plus, there’s an implementation of checking
weather with weather.gov, UV exposure
from an EPA API, and AQI from AirNow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The gRPC is a high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It provides bi-directional streaming. gRPC services can be defined using protocol buffers, a powerful binary serialization toolset, and language, and provides tools for generating clients and servers across different languages. Now you can deploy Spring apps with gRPC support in Azure Spring Apps.
For a demonstration of this process, see the following video:
