        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article is intended to guide you in supporting ES6 Modules import on Node.js on Windows App Service and also an introduction to ES modules as well as ES import.
 
Node.js has two module systems:
1)  CommonJS modules and
2)  ECMAScript modules.
 
1) CommonJS: The de facto standard for modules in Node.js currently  is CommonJS. CommonJS modules are defined in normal .js files using module.exports or .cjs.
Modules can be used later within other .js files with the require() function.
Import using require (Common JS) :
 
// foo.js
module.exports = function() {
  return 'Hello foo!';
}

// index.js
var foo = require('./foo');
console.log(foo()); // Hello foo!

Security Challenges with Passwords
 
Passwords should be used with caution, and developers must never place passwords in an unsecured location. Many Java applications connect to backend data, cache, messaging, and eventing services using usernames and passwords, or other sensitive credentials such as access tokens or connection strings. If exposed, the passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as a sales catalog that you built for an upcoming campaig…]]></summary>

You can now build production Serverless Apps with Azure Functions v4 in the .NET Isolated Worker model with .NET Framework 4.8. The isolation model decouples your function process from the Azure Functions runtime, giving the flexibility to target different versions of .NET, and more efficiently manages dependencies and service registrations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can use client side decryption of properties on Azure Spring Apps by following the steps below:
Add the encrypted property in your .properties file in your git repository.It would look like:


message={cipher}f43e3df3862ab196a4b367624a7d9b581e1c543610da353fbdd2477d60fb282f


Update the Config Server on Azure Spring App to use the git repository which has our encrypted property. You could do it directly from Azure Portal or use Azure CLI:
az spring-cloud config-server git set -n myspringcloud --uri <git_repo_url>

In your Spring Boot application, add the decryption key in the bootstrap.yml file. (You would need to create it if it does not exist)


encrypt:
  key: somerandomkey



[This is the key you would have used in order to encrypt your property earlier]Now, add some code to get the value of the encrypted property.


package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {

    @Value("${message:default}") 
    String message;

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return message;
    }

}



Create an App, or deploy to an existing one.
az spring-cloud app create -n <appName>

 
Deploy your app.
az spring-cloud app deploy -n appName --jar-path <location_of_jar>

 
Assign a public endpoint (or use the Test Endpoints)
az spring-cloud app update -n appName --assign-endpoint true

 
Access your application to view the value.
https://<myspringcloud>-<appName>.azuremicroservices.io/

 
(Optional) You can check the encrypted values on the Config Server by following the steps mentioned in thisdocumentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-access-data-plane-azure-ad-rbac]]></summary>

GitHub repositories I’ve committed to since 2013, the
number is decreasing. Same with number of commits, but
that’s almost entirely because in 2017 I learned
how to use amend
to combine my haphazard commits into logical chunks.

And, sure, another element of this trend is that I stopped
working on so many tiny npm modules
and instead worked on applications.
But systematic factors aside – what you see here is focus.

In a previous post, we introduced the isolated process model, which decouples your function code from the core Azure Functions host, in contrast to the traditional model where we run them together in the same process. Functions V4 supports .NET 6 in both models, and the isolated process model also supports .NET 7 (public preview) and Framework 4.8 (public preview). In this update, we’ll re-cap some of our recent updates, outline some changes to look forward to, and expand on our thinking about future versions.

Network with community members and peers to learn about the latest Java innovations on Kubernetes.  It's a free, one-day online event, so attend a few sessions or stay on for the whole thing. 
 
Join us for a full day of sessions, including those presented my Microsoft Java product and Advocate teams, to help you gain valuable industry insights and vital job skills from the Java-4-Kubernetes community experts.
 
Microsoft's event schedule includes:

What's up at Eclipse Adoptium? -- by George Adams
Take the suckage out of Microservices with Container Apps -- by Rory Preddy
Secrets of Performance Tuning Java on Kubernetes -- by Bruno Borges
Deploying to Spring boot apps to Kubernetes with GitHub Actions and feature flags -- by Brian Benz and Stephanie Crater

 

 
This year's keynote by Mark Little, VP of Engineering at Red Hat, will be on "Transactional Microservices in Kube-native Manner" where he dives into the role it place in distributed computing, which is not necessarily the kind of transaction developers typically use. Quarkus and Eclipse MicroProfile are examples of what this looks like today.
 
Special guest speaker, Lasada Pippen is a ground up, self-established engineering and technologist who now inspires people to overcome odds and face difficulties to pursue your dreams. For J4K, he will talk about "Hidden Gems" that you are and how to make cloud companies recognize this. Lasada will help you identify how valuable you are even if you're not being immediately recognized, how to navigate through this, and overcome hurdles to harness your success.
 
This is a once-a-year event with over two dozen sessions, exciting keynotes, and lots of learnings. So, what do you have to lose? Register for free and join the Java on Kubernetes community on September 28, 2022. Reserve your seat now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here are the steps you can follow to configure the Config Server on Azure Spring Apps which uses SSH authentication to connect to a git repository on GitHub.
Create your keys using the following command on your terminal


ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "test@mymail.com"



This will create a public key (.pub) and a private key.
Copy the public key on GitHub
Go to your GitHub account -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys Click on New SSH key and copy the public key here.
Configure the Config Server on Azure Spring Apps
Go to the Azure Spring Apps Service -> Config ServerSpecify the GitHub URL, Label etc. and choose SSH as the Authentication protocol. Copy your private key in the text box and save.

(Optional) To ensure that the key works, you can test it on the local system as well.
Refer: Clone GitHub Repository using SSH


eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add <private key>

git clone <GIT_URL>
#Example of the URL: git@github.com:username/testconfig.git



You should now have access to your private GitHub Repository via SSH from Azure Spring Apps.]]></summary>

1. Go to the Kudu Site of the WebApp via Advanced Tools blade:
 

 
2. Click on SSH to ssh into the Application Container:
 

3. Get the PID of the Java Process (your application):
[There are multiple ways to get it. We can use ps -ef | grep java | grep -v grep command, or simply run jcmd]
 

 
4. Finally, execute the following command to collect the Thread Dump and save it as a file. 
 
jcmd <PID of Java Process> Thread.print > /home/threaddump
Similarly, to collect the heap dump, run:jcmd <PID of Java Process> GC.heap_dump /home/heapdump

We built a lot of stuff together at Mapbox, from iD
to Mapbox Studio. But he was
insistent that after this job, he was going to make games and comics.
No more tech rocket ships.
He’s gone and done it. Saman, along with Micah Fitch and Tom Lubanovic, released
Wilderplace today. It’s an endlessly creative
turn-based adventure game.

It’s been in the works since 2019, and has all the marks of
a gesamkunstwerk.
Everything is handmade, from the hand-drawn animations to the fonts,
which Saman created from scratch and released on GitHub.

Micah wrote a soundtrack that organically combines motifs as you progress
through the game, and uses the still pretty cutting-edge web audio tech to
emulate synthesizers.


I’ve been lucky to play beta versions of the game, but it’s progressed
really far in the last year. You can play it with a game controller, it has
this inventory system, it’s all a pretty impressive technical achievement,
on top of a fun game. And now it’s released, and you
can buy it on Steam
or check out wilderplace.place.]]></summary>

However, one important factor that can be overlooked is that the test system itself needs to be running smoothly - otherwise the accuracy of your test results will be compromised!
 
While running a load test in Azure Load Testing you might wonder if you’ve configured the correct number threads (users) in your Apache JMeter script. A thread runs through a transaction from start to finish, and then repeats until the test is over. You may notice that a test runs successfully with a lower number of threads, but the test may fail with errors once you increase the load.

Symptom
Connection from the 2012R2 on-prem Windows server to the AKS would fail, with the error message: 

 
Troubleshooting

Capture the network trace, and you will find Encrypted Alert during the TLS handshake:


2. Note that the handshake would fail immediately after the client hello. This means TLS handshake fails to establish, and most often it's due to the server and client does not have common cipher suites to exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Function App under at least a Premium plan could have unlimited execution time. However, it might caused a duplicated invocation issue with a ServiceBus trigger because the "PeekLock" duration is up to 5 minutes (including renew).
 
It is a tutorial to reproduce such the scenario.
 
STEP 1: In Azure portal, create a new Premium python Function App and a Service Bus + Queue
 
STEP 2: Download the sample code and apply some changes.
https://cchlab.blob.core.windows.net/cchlab/cchlabsbf.zip
In "host.json", please specify the Function App timeout and the ServiceBus PeekLock timeout as below.

In "ServiceBusQueueTrigger1/function.json", please setup some configuration:
SBQ_STRING=<your service bus queue name>

Then, deploy the project to Function App.
 
STEP 3: Making an experiment with a short execution time.
Visit: https://<YourAppName>.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t=<DurationInSecond>
Please specify the "DurationInSecond" to 30 this time, and you may see the result like this:

We apply this operation to send a message to the ServiceBus queue and told the ServiceBus trigger to pause 30 seconds before execution.
Now, please go to the monitor page:

You can see it is just a normal short invocation.
 
STEP 4: Making an experiment with a long execution time.
Visit: https://<YourAppName>.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t=<DurationInSecond>
Please specify the "DurationInSecond" to 330 this time, and you may see the result like this:

Now, please go to the monitor page:

As you can see, there are duplicate invocations with the same message id, which might caused some potential business issues if we ignore them.
 
Conclusion:
Since we cannot adjust "maxAutoRenewDuration" to more than 5 minutes, we could only reduce the execution time from this ServiceBus trigger.]]></summary>

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.]]></summary>

Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they'd been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the search for eternal youth, fecal transplants may seem like an unlikely way to reverse the aging process. However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>
