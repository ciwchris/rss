I’ve been using Fastmail exclusively since then and have only good things to say about it. The user interface is rock-solid and fast, and there have been very few times that they’ve had a server outage. But it’s just been qualitatively better than Gmail, not differentiated by a feature.
Masked email
That’s changed: I think that Fastmail’s “Masked Email” is a good reason for the Gmail-faithful to switch. It’s both a fantastic way to manage spam sources and a real win for privacy.
Masked email works best when you also use 1Password. You can then link your 1Password and Fastmail accounts, and whenever you see a signup form on the web, not only wil…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With shadow >= 4.14.0, Arch Linux's default password hashing algorithm changed from SHA512 to yescrypt [1].
Furthermore, the umask [2] settings are now configured in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile.
This should not require any manual intervention.
Reasons for Yescrypt
The password-based key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing scheme yescrypt has been chosen due to its adoption (readily available in libxcrypt, which is used by pam [3]) and its stronger resilience towards password cracking attempts over SHA512.
Although the winner of the Password Hashing Competition [4] has been argon2, this even more resilient algorithm is not yet available in libxcrypt [5][6].
Configuring yescrypt
The YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR setting in /etc/login.defs is currently without effect, until pam implements reading its value [7]. If a YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR higher (or lower) than the default (5) is needed, it can be set using the rounds option of the pam_unix [8] module (i.e. in /etc/pam.d/system-auth).
General list of changes
yescrypt is used as default password hashing algorithm, instead of SHA512
pam honors the chosen ENCRYPT_METHOD in /etc/login.defs and does not override the chosen method anymore
changes in the filesystem (>= 2023.09.18) and pambase (>= 20230918) packages ensure, that umask is set centrally in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile

If so, you might be interested in using Managed Identities (MSI) or Service Principals to authenticate and authorize your app service to another app service that is protected by Azure Active Directory (AAD) using built-in authentication (Easy-Auth). 
 
In this article, I will show you how to use MSI or Service Principal of app1 to access app2, which is a custom resource that requires AAD authentication.
 
Normally, we would use the MSI-validator tool to test the functionality of MSI. However, it only supports specific resources and requires a pre-defined resource value. Currently, it can only use the following resources: default, keyvault, storage, and …]]></summary>

The short answer was no, so we built one! 
We are open-sourcing the code for this solution so that other publishers can adopt this approach to ensure customers' Managed applications are secure. For more context on the solution described here please read Microsoft documentation on planning a Managed application and Azure Policy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you're deploying a web application that relies on a database. Instead of manually configuring the database each time you deploy your application, you can use an Init Container to handle this task. The Init Container can run scripts to create tables, seed initial data, or set up the database schema. Once the database is ready, the main application container can safely start, knowing that the required database structure is in place.
 
The below example defines an init container which runs under the same pod as main app container, seeds data to an existing Azure MySQL Database which will be used by the main web app container to serve contents onto the landing page.
 

 
The init container inserts a record into an existing table named myguests in Azure My SQL DB using a python script. The script contains code for connecting to the Database alongside inserting record into the Database. This data will then be retrieved and used by the main app container which is also running a python Flask based web application and return the value in the landing page.
 
Dockerfile for Init Container
 
 
 
FROM python
COPY . .
RUN pip install mysql && pip install mysql-connector-python
CMD ["python", "test.py"]

 
 
 
 
Python Script for Init Container
 
 
 
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="init-test.mysql.database.azure.com",
  user="*******",
  password="*******",
  database="*****"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'test@outlook.com')"

mycursor.execute(sql)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) affected")

 
 
 
 
Output from Init Container
 

 
 
 
Dockerfile for main app container

RUN pip install mysql-connector && pip install flask

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ensuring that your applications perform seamlessly under load is crucial. The last thing you want is for a code change or new feature to negatively impact your app's performance. That's where load testing swoops in to save the day. But what if we told you there's an even cooler way to handle load testing? Yep, you guessed it – automating it with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Azure Pipelines and Azure Load Testing.
 
Why automate load tests with CI/CD?
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, let's understand why automating load tests with CI/CD is a game-changer:

Detect issues early: By integrating load tests into your CI/CD pipeline, you can detect performance issues early . Address problems before they reach production, reducing the impact on end-users.

When using zip deploy way to deploy to function app from Azure DevOps, the new deployment never complete at DevOps side until manually cancel it.
 
Bad: 

 
Good:

 
Resolution: 
1. Enable debug log at DevOps side and then check if there are many requests to "/api/deployments/latest" with 202, if yes, continue.  
2. Check under "LogFiles/kudu/trace" in kudu portal, find log with name like below at the same time range for current deployment. If many logs show the deployment is pending at same deployment id, then continue. 

3. Go to "site/deployments" in kudu portal to find the folder whose name is same as the deployment id, then check status.xml or status_complete.xml and log.log inside the folder. If status in status.xml or status_complete.xml is not Success or Failed, then we can try to resolve the issue by removing this folder under "site/deployments".
4. Check the log with name like below under "LogFiles/kudu/trace" at the same time for the non-completed deployment task to get more details of the cause why the deployment at that time was not completed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some scenarios, you might need to preprocess files before they're used by your application. For instance, you're deploying a machine learning model that relies on precomputed data files. An Init Container can download, extract, or preprocess these files, ensuring they are ready for the main application container. This approach simplifies the deployment process and ensures that your application always has access to the required data.
 
The below example defines a simple Pod that has an init container which downloads a file from some resource to a file share which is shared between the init and main app container. The main app container is running a php-apache image and serves the landing page using the index.php file downloaded into the shared file space.
 

 
The init container mounts the shared volume at /mydir , and the main application container mounts the shared volume at /var/www/html. The init container runs the following command to download the file and then terminates: wget -O /mydir/index.php http://info.cern.ch. 
 
Configurations and dockerfile for init container:
 

Mount the storage file share on the environment level
Create init container with mounting file share named init on path /mydir:


 
 

Dockerfile for init which downloads an index.php file under /mydir:

 
FROM busybox:1.28 
WORKDIR / 
ENTRYPOINT ["wget", "-O", "/mydir/index.php", "http://info.cern.ch"]
 
 
 
Configuration for main app container:
 

Create main app container mounting file share named init on path /var/www/html:


 
 

Main app container configuration which uses php-apache image and serves the index.php file from DocumentRoot /var/www/html:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Web App for Containers is a lightweighted way to manage app by docker image. CD (Continuous Deployment) is a common way to pull the updated docker image from docker registry (such as Azure Continer Registray or Docker Hub etc) to App Service automatically.

 

While if App Service enables Private Endpoint, the webhook from container registry should be blocked with 403 since the public access to the App Service kudu site (advanced tool site) is blocked by default. And when webhook event is trying sent to app service via Private Endpoint, it should fail with IP forbidden.


 
With the situation, this blog provide a workaround by allowing webhook IP to access App Service kudu site via public access and keep the remaining traffic go through Private Endpoint. So the diagram as below:

We announced the General Availability of WordPress on App Service one year ago, in August 2022 with 3 paid hosting plans.
