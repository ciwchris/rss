        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authentication is a key step in the user journey of any application. Going about designing the authentication flow can be confusing and not straightforward. When load testing an application, this generally is the first step in the user journey.  Supplying client credentials through a UI is not possible when load testing an application, so is evaluating how to implement specific authentication flows available on Azure, as they can be tedious and time consuming as well.
Within this series, we will cover the authentication flows and scenarios that are possible with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the identity provider.
At the end of the blog, you will be able to

Use Azure AD to Authenticate a web application hosted on Azure App Service using the client credential grant flow.

Cloud computing revolutionized how a business can establish its digital presence. Nowadays, by leveraging cloud features such as scalability, elasticity, and convenience, businesses can deploy, grow, or test an environment in every corner of the world without worrying about building the required infrastructure.
 
Unlike the traditional model, which was based on notifying the service provider to set up the resources for customers in advance, in an on-demand model, cloud providers implement application programming interfaces (API) that can be used by customers to deploy resources on demand. This allows the customer to access an unlimited amount of resources on-demand and only pay for the resources they use without worrying about th…]]></summary>

addition to this, a new set of php-legacy packages have been
introduced. These will follow the oldest but still actively supported
PHP branch. This enables users to install the latest version but also
introduces the option to use third party applications that might rely
on an older version. Both branches will be kept up to date following
our rolling release model. php and php-legacy can be installed at the
same time as the latter uses a -legacy suffix for its binaries and
configuration files.
In addition to this, the php7 packages have been removed as they
reached end of life. The imap extension will no longer be provided as
it relies on the c-client library which has been abandoned for many

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note that official support for PHP 8 will only be available on Linux, as a result of this App Service will only support PHP 8 on Apps Service Linux instances. For additional information on this topic: PHP on App Service, php.internals: Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows.
 
This article will demonstrate on how to use PHP 8 for App Service Windows, since there would be no official support from Microsoft for it, please use at your own risk.
 
Generally, we are following this post: How to use a Custom PHP runtime for App Service Windows - (azureossd.github.io) to download a custom PHP runtime and map Handler for it.
 
1. Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.

 
2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:

 
3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:
 
 
mkdir php
curl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\php.zip
cd php
unzip php.zip
 
 


 
4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is "*.php", the Script processor is "C:\home\php\php-cgi.exe". Then save it. All the configuration is done.

 
5. To verify it, we can create an "index.php" file under C:\home\site\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:
 
<?
phpinfo();
 
 

 
I hope you enjoy it.]]></summary>

Popular "orb" icon in results, has been replaced by a "shield" icon in a slight redesign to accomodate for the upcoming AI tools.
Added an icon to host links to manipulate the results. Currently it is "Open in Web Archive" and "More from this site". We will be adding more in the future.
Maps: UI design improvements to Directions/Navigation Controls (button icons/spacing/padding/etc)
Maps: Addition of "My Location" button, for setting starting-point as user-location
Maps: Addition of a "Drop Pin" button, for manually setting a start point via mouse


Improved
You can't directly switch from a lense to a non-All search (e.g. Images, News) with JS disabled #61 @gesumin
Plan selection does not work without JS on onboarding


Fixed
Zero results for “Best Headphones” – is shopping search broken right now? #1109 @quinncom
Search results sections do not all honor personalized results settings #1133 @ryandary
Both "Web" and "Lens" being shown as active when a lens is enabled

However, it is still in Preview status, so it is not recommended to use it in Production environment. There are also some limitations. In this article, I would like to use a sample app service to introduce a method to do the same thing by using nginx and custom docker container.
 
Note
The current method does not obey the recommendation of Docker that a docker container should host only one service, and we actually recommend customers use Azure Container App for hosting multiple applications.
 
Design
We will create a Docker container to have nginx installed and use it as a reverse proxy to redirect the request from external to different applications.

It started 4 years ago when ACR added support for Helm Chart distribution using the existing registry services users have already configured for their secure environments. We knew Helm adoption would require support across all registries which initiated the OCI Artifacts and ORAS projects.

But what if you want to test the system to make sure it can handle a desired number of requests per second (RPS) ? For example, you may want to load test a payment gateway service for the number of transactions that can be processed every second. RPS or throughput is a crucial metric that reveals fundamental information about the tested system. Every system has a critical point in terms of throughput. Once the system reaches the critical point, it might keep the throughput around the same level, but the response times go up  or the requests get throttled.

Reading
This month’s theme, looking back on it, was feminism, and so I read
Bad Sex, which was
on quite a few best-of-2022 lists. It was fine, but mostly whetted
my appetite for the books that it referenced. The
Right to Sex on
the other hand, was a perfect sort of thought-provoking thesis that
explored a bunch of surprising topics with a lot of intellectual
power.
I’ve been experimenting with switching from my usual setup -

Update – v1.5.0
.NET 7 support for the isolated worker extension
According to the Azure Functions roadmap, Azure Functions isolated worker model has started supporting .NET 7. Therefore, this OpenAPI extension also starts supporting .NET 7 with the isolated worker model. The migration step is as easy as changing the target framework. Update your .csproj file and find the <TargetFramework> node, and change it from netcoreapp3.1 (.NET Core 3.1), net5.0 (.NET 5) or net6.0 (.NET 6), to net7.0 (.NET 7).
