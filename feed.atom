It offers many awesome features, and APIM Policies is one of the ones. For example, You can use the APIM policies to extends the APIM features or configure security policies to protect your backend APIs. While you need to write the policy documents in the XML format, it has a fairly bit amount of learning curves – it's not that easy to use.
 
Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how GitHub Copilot helps us write the APIM policy documents, with a few technical scenarios.

WordPress Multisite – quick recap
WordPress Multisite is a feature of WordPress that enables you to run, manage and administer multiple WordPress websites from a single WordPress installation.

Once you set up a new WordPress website on App Service, you can access your website using the URL <app-name>.azurewebsites.net. Custom Domains are domain names that reflect your brand or company. For example, microsoft.com is the custom domain used by Microsoft for their website. In this article, we will learn about how we can use Custom Domains and subdomains with our WordPress website on App Service.
 
You can buy an App Service domain and use it with your WordPress website. App Service Domains are custom domains that are managed directly in Azure. Also, if you have an existing custom domain registered with any other registrar, you can use that with your WordPress website as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Q1: What are cipher suites and how do they work on App Service?

A cipher suite is a set of instructions that contains algorithms and protocols to help secure network connections between clients and servers. By default, the front-end’s OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.
App Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

        <link href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-increase-concurrency-on-python-function-app-hosted-in-app/ba-p/3882010"/>
        <updated>2023-07-24T07:26:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.
 

Based on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.
 
Lab1:
code:
sync

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1
Result:
It took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.

Lab2:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2
Result:
It took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

 
Lab3:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

Lab4:
code:
async

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

 
Conclusion:
1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency. 
2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.
