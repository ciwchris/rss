        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background:In most cases, the best authentication method for Azure services is by using a managed identity. However, there are scenarios where this may not be an option, and access keys or passwords are used. In such cases, it is important to rotate access keys and passwords regularly.
 
Automatic Secret rotation solution:Based on the document (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/tutorial-rotation-dual?tabs=azure-cli), it proposes a solution to generate new access keys on storage account and update it in the key vault based on the secret expiry time. It uses Azure Event Grid to send the secret expiry event to an Azure Function App (aka the Azure Function App triggered by Azure Event Grid notifications) – which in turn generates the new access key and updates the secre…]]></summary>

Cloud application development introduces unique challenges: applications are distributed, scale horizontally, communicate asynchronously, have automated deployments, and are built to handle failures resiliently. This demands a shift in both technical approach and mindset.
So Cloud Native is not about technologies, if you can do all of the above, then you are Cloud Native. You don’t have to use Kubernetes for instance, to become Cloud Native.

Discovering applications can be a challenge, especially in the case of bulk migrations of large environments potentially containing hundreds or more applications. Azure Migrate makes discovery of web apps, servers, and even databases simpler than ever. Just run the appropriate Azure Migrate tool in your VM or on-prem environment to generate an inventory of applications, servers, and databases.

The documentation on this topic is scarce and often outdated or incomplete. Moreover, you may have specific requirements for your use case that are not covered by the existing resources. That is why I have created this comprehensive guide using the latest Azure cloud resources.
 
In this guide, you will learn how to set up an AKS cluster and provide authentication to that cluster using NGINX and the OAuth2 proxy. This guide is intended for educational purposes only and does not guarantee proper authentication as certified by NIST. It is also not a complete solution for securing your AKS cluster, which involves more than just …]]></summary>

Well, buckle up, because JMeter has a sweet trick up its sleeve called script recording. Skip the manual coding and let JMeter capture your app clicks like a digital detective.

Our systems can sometimes be a black box. We toss a request into it and get something back, but what goes on inside? Cutting through the tech jargon, observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.
 
You might wonder, isn’t that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there’s a glitch slowing things down (that’s the “What”). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the “Why”).
 
Let’s say an app is responding slowly. We might have all these cool charts and graphs showing us the problem, but do they tell us why it’s happening? Not always.
 
That’s where solid observability comes in…]]></summary>

While the complete implementation is still in progress, we want to provide you with a sneak peek into this upcoming feature.

In this blog post, we'll delve into the Sidecar pattern, its significance, and practical ways to leverage it for your applications.
What is the Sidecar Pattern
Applications and services often require related functionality, such as monitoring, logging, configuration, and networking services. These peripheral tasks can be implemented as separate components or services, built using different languages and technologies.

Distributed Tracing allows you to correlate operations together and track requests between services. This is especially useful for Durable Functions apps as they coordinate work across multiple services and VMs.

If you want to move your WordPress website from any hosting platform to App Service, this plugin is for you. The plugin copies all your content from your existing site to a new WordPress site in App Service without impacting the existing site, so that you can verify and test your new site before making it available to visitors.
 
In this article, we will learn how to use the migration plugin to move your WordPress site to App Service.

balance and whether it’s a good or bad idea to work hard when you’re
young. Like most of these recurring debates, it has generated two
opposite archetypes:
The anti-capitalist tells the young worker not to trust HR and not to
buy into the idea of work as family. Your employment contract is the
only thing that binds you to your job, and that can be terminated on
either side. Arrive at 9, leave at 5. Prioritize the family.
The hustlebro tells you to wake up at 7am and get to work, and
give it your all. Hustle, and earn as much as you can, build those
connections. You can get work-life balance when you’re older, your
early 20s are the time for making that cheddar and staying
up till 1am.

Recently, I've been building an app using .NET Aspire which I'm using PostgreSQL as the database and Azure Storage Blobs and Queues in.
.NET Aspire is awesome for this, as you can setup a developer inner loop super simply with the components that ship, and the nice thing about this is that locally PostgreSQL is run in a Docker container and Azure Storage uses the Azurite storage emulator (which also happens to run in a container).
The problem with this is that when you restart your app, you lose all the data in the database and storage emulator, since they are started fresh each time.
Turns out, it's a pretty easy fix - all that you need to do is mount a volume into the cont…]]></summary>

When you use the download results option, the ALT service splits the results into one CSV file per engine. This ensures that the file size is not huge, and it is easy to open the files in tools like notepad, excel to analyze the data. In cases where your input data is split across test engines, you can pick the results file for a specific engine and analyze.

        <updated>2024-01-22T07:31:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service supports HTTP 2.0. The major advance of HTTP/1.1 was the use of persistent connections to service multiple requests in a row. In HTTP/2, a persistent connection can be used to service multiple simultaneous requests. 
 
This blog will demonstrate how you can send HTTP 2.0 Request to app service for testing using C#:
 
Step 1:
Go to > App Service > Configuration > Enable HTTP 2.0

 
Step 2:
Create a .Net Core Console Application / Web Application as per requirement . In this example I have taken a .Net Core Console Application:
 
 
var client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://<>.azurewebsites.net") };

            Console.WriteLine("Sending HTTP 2.0 Request.");

            // HTTP/2 request
            using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "/") { Version = new Version(2, 0) })
            using (var response = await client.SendAsync(request))
                Console.WriteLine(response);


 
 
The HTTPClient class has DefaultRequestVersion property with which you can set the default version of the requests as below:
 
 
var SecondRequest = new HttpClient()
            {
                BaseAddress = new Uri("https://<>.azurewebsites.net"),
                DefaultRequestVersion = new Version(2, 0)
            };

            // HTTP/2 is default
            using (var response = await SecondRequest.GetAsync("/"))
                Console.WriteLine(response);
 
 
You should be able to see a successful HTTP Response once the code executes:
 

 
For more information you can refer the below documents:

HttpClient Class (System.Net.Http) | Microsoft Learn
HttpClient.DefaultRequestVersion Property (System.Net.Http) | Microsoft Learn
