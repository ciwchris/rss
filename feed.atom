Apps like Microsoft Loop, Figma, Notion, Miro, Framer are redefining remote collaboration. 
Beyond hosting the newest and latest version of a file, these modern collaboration apps allow users to make edits to the same file at the same time as if they were physically next to each other.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their increasingly sophisticated capabilities, we’d like to explore how AI can further facilitate teamwork using the aforementioned collaboration applications.

The mainstream way of interacting with a language model is through a familiar chat interface. One characteristic about this interaction that’s relevant to our discussion is that it’s…]]></summary>

If your organization hasn’t yet made the switch, consider this blog a gentle nudge to prioritize your migration to App Service Environment v3 before the Aug. 31, 2024, deadline. As a reminder, starting on Jan. 15, 2024, users will no longer be able to create a new App Service Environment v1 or v2. Even though support for existing v1 or v2 environments will continue until the Aug. 31 deadline, App Service Environment created after Jan 15 will be on version 3. To avoid potential disruptions and ensure the seamless operation of your services, we strongly recommend initiating the migration process without del…]]></summary>

Durable Functions (DF) enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. 
 
There are two major changes introduced in this release: upgrading to the latest version of the Azure Storage SDK (a breaking change for .NET in-process apps) and the introduction of a new partition manager. We describe these and the motivation for each in the sections below. 
 
Please note: 

At this time, DF extension v3.0.0-rc.1 is only supported in the App Service Plan. Auto-scaling support for the Consumption and Elastic Premium plans will be announced later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Developers love containerization for its ability to ensure consistency, portability and manageability of their applications, while aligning with modern DevOps practices. Azure Container Apps is a great platform for running polyglot apps and containers of all kinds in Azure, as it abstracts away the complexity of managing underlying Kubernetes while providing unified networking, observability, and scaling for higher developer velocity. While it serves as a versatile container platform, it may not offer precise insights into your Java applications or the state of your Java execution environment (such as the JVM). To better cater to our Java-centric customers running containerized apps, we've recently initiated a new journey to enhance the Java developer experience on Azure Container Apps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that the migration of the bugtracker to GitLab is done! 🥳 
Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!
This means the issue tracker and merge requests on the GitLab package repos are now enabled.
The old bugtracker will subsequently be closed down. For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked Task #56716) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.
Packaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the "Add a new Bug" button on the package page on archlinux.org will automatically direct you to the correct place to open the issue. The workflow afterwards is mostly the same, first our Bug Wranglers will have a look at the issues and triage them, and then they will be handed over to the respective Package Maintainers to fix. A list of all issues can be found here.
If you do not have an account for GitLab already (which authenticates against our SSO service), please write us a mail with your desired username to accountsupport@archlinux.org as advised in the banner.]]></summary>

I love shopping! I do. I love commerce — the dance of it, the etiquette. I love it as buyer and seller both. I love considering alternatives, and I love being considered. I love settling on favorites. I love stumbling across surprises.
Am I simply bourgeois? Yes, and I’ll wave that flag proudly. This is a big part of my politics: which is not a politics of “free markets” or “free trade”, but rather of systems that can support commerce and craft at every level, especially the smallest and most careful.
