Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the managed Kubernetes offering from Azure, allows customers to offload the operational overhead to Azure, thus letting the user focus primarily on their workloads and business logic. However, as users migrate large scale workloads to containers, they often create a large number of AKS clusters for various reasons – clusters in different environments (QA/test, staging, prod), clusters in different regions for high availability or localization/proximity, or using clusters to achieve strong isolation between workloads. But the large number of clusters may result in platform admins having to dea…]]></summary>

Most customers tell us they prefer to run a larger number of smaller clusters, but some very large workloads can be run much more efficiently on bigger clusters. To support this, we have increased the number of nodes you can have in a single Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from 1,000 to 5,000.  This will allow you to reduce the number of clusters needed to run your workloads, reducing the operational overhead needed to support application teams.
 
When using the uptime SLA you can request a quota increase across all node pools in the cluster by raising a support request.

In the previous post in this series, we added a new "virtual" field to our GraphQL schema for Post, related:
 

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  url: Url!
  date: Date
  tags: [String!]!
  description: String
  content: String!
  related(tag: String): [Post!]
}
    
 
But in doing so, we added a problem, let's take this query as an example:
 

query {
  posts {
    related {
      related {
        related {
          related {
            related {
              related {
                related {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuing on from the last post in which we used Azure API Management's (APIM) Synthetic GraphQL feature to create a GraphQL endpoint for my blog, I wanted to explore how to add a completely new field to our type - Related Posts.
Using the schema editor in APIM I added a new field to the Post type of related(tag: String): [Post!], so our type now looks like this:
 
 
 

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  url: Url!
  date: Date
  tags: [String!]!
  description: String
  content: String!
  related(tag: String): [Post!]
}
    
 
 
 
The way this field resolver will work is that if you provide a tag argument to related then it'll return posts that also have that tag (while first validating that the tag is a tag of the Post), and if you don't provide a tag argument, it'll return all post…]]></summary>

Sometimes, we may encounter the following error when accessing wordpress website.
 

 
It is very easy to understand that there is something wrong with the connection between the website and database. But how can we find more detailed information regarding this error?
 
We can enable WordPress debugging mode to check the detailed error message. The steps are as below.
 
1.Login to the newui of the scm site.(https://{sitename}.scm.azurewebsites.net/newui)
2.Click File Manager and find the wp-config.php file under site/wwwroot folder.
 

  
3.Change "define( 'WP_DEBUG', false);" to "define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );" in wp-config.php file. We can edit it directly from the newui portal.
 
With this change, you can try to access the wordpress site again without restarting the app service. You will see the detailed error message when accessing the website.

 
You may see below possible error messages. I added some suggestions for each kind of error for your reference.
 
Error 1: mysqli_real_connect(): (HY000/1045): Access denied for user 'gyomnlmsxk1'@'10.0.0.254' (using password: YES) in /home/site/wwwroot/wp-includes/wp-db.php on line 1753

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scenario
Goal: Blob storage can access only from the app service.So, you want to set the blob storage firewall for inbound traffic.
 
Blob storage firewall limitation in this scenario
1. IP address
 IP network rules have no effect on requests originating from the same Azure region as the storage account.
 See Grant access from an internet IP range 
2. Service tag
 There isn't an App service tag.

 
ps. When clients request blob storage through app service, blob storage receives not App service IP but Client IP.
 
Workaround
1. Add IP address when app service and storage are located in a different region.
When resources are located in a different region, the IP address firewall setting works.
2. Firewall with Virtual Network
When blob storage uses VNet firewall, app service must be integrated with VNet.
If you want to read what is VNet integration, see VNet integration 

 
Before setting VNet integration, you must check limitations.
Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
 
1. Set Vnet Integration on the app service
Add VNet to your app service.
I use "firwall-storage-vnet" VNet as below.
 

 
2. Blob storage firewall setting with VNet which is integrated with app service

3. If you use a function app, please add WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET = 1
A value of 1 enables your function app to scale when you have your storage account restricted to a virtual network. 
You can see the detail about this setting website_contentovervnet]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Static Web Apps automatically builds and deploys dozens of frontend frameworks, one of them is Nuxt. Today, we're excited to share that you can deploy Nuxt 3 applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps.
 
While Nuxt 2 is known for its ease of use, Nuxt 3 brings even faster performance and improved developer experience with a thrilling new set of underlying technologies and features. With the release of Nuxt 3’s release candidate in April 2022, developers witnessed a complete re-architect of the framework. Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge also work with Azure Static Web Apps.
 
What’s new in Nuxt 3? 
 

Zero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps 
API routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories 
Vue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability 
Nitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static 
Vite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production 

Universal rendering vs static rendering
 
Previously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.
 
With Nuxt 3's support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering. 
 
To learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.

The dehumidifiers turned off, the humidifiers on. The A/C off,
the heat on. I’m still, more than a year after leaving the west coast,
grateful for the presence of seasons to keep me aware of time passing,
but now I’m aware of time passing.

I got some film photos back, out of my Hasselblad and Olympus XA-2
cameras. This time both rolls had some good photos on them. Taking
the film out of the Hasselblad, I broke one of the light seals, again,
so I have to fix it, again. There’s a man who sells a kit to fix
the seal on eBay - a piece of mylar and a few tiny slices of foam.
It works. He must do some robust business, given how easily
those parts seem to break.

In September, I traveled a little bit, to SatSummit,

Adaptive sampling is enabled by default.
Fixed-rate sampling is not supported.
Ingestion sampling only applies when no other sampling is in effect. Therefore, this is also disabled by default in the wake of point #1 above.

 
 
If you expect data (invocations) under Monitor but do not find it as shown in screenshot below, you have either changed Host.Results category to Warning (or above) level; or your application telemetry is getting sampled. To fix the former, open Host.json file and change the Host.Results category to Information level.
 
{
  "logging": {
    "fileLoggingMode": "always",
    "logLevel": {
      "default": "Information",
      "Host.Results": "Information",
      "Function": "Error",
      "Host.Aggregator": "Trace"
    }
  }
}
 
 
If Host.Results category is already set at Information level, disable telemetry sampling as the next step.
 

 
 
 
To disable the sampling, set "isEnabled": false in host.json file as shown below -
 
{
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": false
       }
    }
  }
}
 
After disabling sampling, you can confirm it by running a query similar to the following; RetainedPercentage should show 100%.
 

 
 
 
 
At this point, the function invocations should start appearing under Monitor on Azure Portal UI.]]></summary>

Node.js has two module systems:
1)  CommonJS modules and
2)  ECMAScript modules.
 
1) CommonJS: The de facto standard for modules in Node.js currently  is CommonJS. CommonJS modules are defined in normal .js files using module.exports or .cjs.
Modules can be used later within other .js files with the require() function.
Import using require (Common JS) :
 
// foo.js
module.exports = function() {
  return 'Hello foo!';
}

// index.js
var foo = require('./foo');
console.log(foo()); // Hello foo!

Passwords should be used with caution, and developers must never place passwords in an unsecured location. Many Java applications connect to backend data, cache, messaging, and eventing services using usernames and passwords, or other sensitive credentials such as access tokens or connection strings. If exposed, the passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as a sales catalog that you built for an upcoming campaig…]]></summary>

You can now build production Serverless Apps with Azure Functions v4 in the .NET Isolated Worker model with .NET Framework 4.8. The isolation model decouples your function process from the Azure Functions runtime, giving the flexibility to target different versions of .NET, and more efficiently manages dependencies and service registrations.

Now scientists have shown that the same may be true for cells, uncovering a newly-discovered mechanism that might help prevent the build-up of tangles of proteins commonly seen in dementia. Scientists have identified a new mechanism that appears to reverse the build-up of aggregates, not by eliminating them completely, but rather by 'refolding' them.]]></summary>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>
