For many years, scientists have assumed that the loss of connections between brain cells caused Alzheimer's-related symptoms, including memory loss, but actual evidence of the role of synaptic loss had been limited to a small number of brain biopsies and post-mortem brain exams conducted on patients with moderate or advanced disease. However, the emergence of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning technology has allowed researchers to observe the loss of synapses in living patients with even mild symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.]]></summary>

When we launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019, we set out to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we’ve had the opportunity to work with many customers to help them adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, Kroger, Liantis, Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley’s, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.
 
Many organizations are running thousands of Spring Boot applications on-premises and need advanced capabilities to accelerate their Sp…]]></summary>

Features


Observability - Monitor applications hosted inside the cluster


Traffic Splitting - Split Ingress Traffic to different versions of an API. Helps  to perform Blue/Green Deployment, A/B Testing, Fault Injection


Distributed Tracing - Trace/Compare Service to Service calls with visualisation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are very happy to announce that debug packages are now available in Arch Linux.
Debug symbols and source listing are provided through our debuginfod instance which can be utilized by debuggers such as gdb and delve.
https://debuginfod.archlinux.org/
A couple of sponsored mirrors are providing the debug repositories while we figure out and communicate the new mirror requirements.
https://america.mirror.pkgbuild.com
https://asia.mirror.pkgbuild.com
https://europe.mirror.pkgbuild.com
Not all packages provide debug packages as enabling it for all packages is an ongoing effort.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Container Apps Virtual Network Integration release announcement
 
At Ignite, we announced Azure Container Apps, a serverless application-centric hosting service that enables users to quickly deploy containerized applications and microservices to Azure without the need to configure and manage underlying infrastructure resources or container orchestrators. Azure Container Apps runs on  Azure Kubernetes Service, and includes several open-source projects: Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA), Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), and Envoy. This open-source foundation enables teams to build and run portable applications powered by Kubernetes and open standards without the operational overhead and management complexity of working with the platform directly.

Azure PowerShell is a set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line. Azure PowerShell is designed to make it easy to learn and get started with, but provides powerful features for automation.
 
Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications.

This article only discuss the Windows Azure App Service, Linux App Service is out of scope of this article. 

 
What happened? 

The Windows Azure App Service platform removed some minor NodeJS version. That could result in some un-expected result if the App Service's configuration is not right. 

 
Is that removement is expected behavior? 

Yes.
Azure App Service is a PaaS service, and the platform will manage the Windows Node version.

in January, and it radically reshaped my conception of local
politics and the general arc of city politics in the last 50 years.
Highly, highly recommended stuff.

Brian Lovin did a design crit of Placemark,
which has been powering a big burst of activity on that front.
The energy on Placemark is happening in two semi-parallel efforts:
knocking out the last few core concepts - layers and properties, mostly -
and running through this new, super-helpful list of ideas and
critiques from Brian. The last few days have been super, super
productive as a result, to the extent that I’ll probably crash
and take a few days off in a little bit. But for now, I’ve
got energy and direction, and I’ve got to ride it.

Reading
This paper on Ethnographic Research on Dynamicland
resonated with me. You can read a lot about the technology
and business of these sorts of efforts, but rarely is there
someone looking for the human interactions, and Dynamicland
is one of the most unusual and ambitious projects out there.
Bachmann doesn’t editorialize much, but I think some
themes emerge, like the tension between “brainstorming”/collaboration versus
authority and vision.
It reminded me of The Idea Factory,
that great book about Bell Labs. Research labs are this odd thing -
part of what made Bell Labs great was the ability to work on a slightly
longer timeline, with fewer limitations on what you created. But
that ability was directly a result of the government’s explicit
permittance of AT&T Bell as a monopoly, during that period of time.
Listening
Townes Van Zandt by Townes Van Zandt

Been on a Townes Van Zandt kick recently, sparked of course
by seeing If I Needed You
pop up in an episode of Patriot.


Almost every time I’m very productive, it coincides with a full listen-through
of the whole Joanna Newsom ouvre. There’s nothing like it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Engineers use fluid dynamics simulations to study the effect of exercise at various ages on plaque formation in the arteries. The authors considered two arterial geometries, one with a bulging outer artery and the other without, and modeled the effect of exercise and age on blood flow. To model exercise, the authors digitized blood flow measurements from individuals in three age groups and used these flowrates as input to their computational model.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service for Linux platform now supports customer using both PHP 7 and PHP 8 built-in docker image. 
When switching from PHP 7 to PHP 8, you may recognize the platform changed the web container from using Apache to Nginx. If you previously defined custom rules in .htaccess will be lost and will highly possible break your app.
 
But Nginx does not have an equivalent to the .htaccess file, you need to update the main configuration and reload Nginx for any changes to take effect. NGINX is designed to be efficient. While using .htaccess can do harm to performance. For more details, please refer to https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/likeapache-htaccess/.
 
This article shows how to deploy a customized Nginx configuration in PHP 8 Linux App Service.
