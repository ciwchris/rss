Typically, open-source Spring project minor releases receive support for a minimum of 12 months from the date of initial release, and then making sure upgrading the Spring version timely before reaching the end-of-life date is a hard commitment to avoid putting your mission-critical workloads at risk.

When we interviewed Socket.IO users, the challenge of scaling out Socket.IO servers came up repeatedly. It’s a challenge that can be met uniquely by Azure.

Containers are popular for cloud native application development and have increasingly become the common target for software supply chain attacks. Thus, delivering tools to help secure containerized software supply chains has been a growing call of AKS customers.
 
Digital signatures provide a way for software consumers to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the containers deployed. Image signing has become one of the most popular solutions to the aforementioned concern. The signed container images enable users to ensure deployments are built from a trusted entity and verify that those images haven't been tampered with since their creation.

This not only increases the development workload but also gives rise to maintenance and security challenges. However, the introduction of a gateway concept provides an innovative solution to these issues.
VMware Spring Cloud Gateway, acting as the first line of defense for all incoming requests, assumes the crucial responsibility of handling identity authentication, verifying user identities, and validating their permissions. This means that each microservice no longer needs to code authentication and authorization independently, thus reducing the development workload significantly.

The company and product side of Placemark didn’t work out.
Some fantastic, friendly people used it, but I couldn’t find a way to make it work
as a sustainable bootstrapped startup. Building it was incredibly fun.
Failing to find success and sustainability was pretty hard but it’s okay.
Here’s the plan:
Today I’m turning off signups to Placemark.io.
Placemark is free for all existing customers until January 19, 2023,
at which point the servers will be shut down.
Later in January, I’ll release the full source code to the site. This might
take a little while. It’s a big application.
Building Placemark was an incredible experience. I learned a ton and got to
know a lot of new people in the process. I’m really proud of what it turned
out to be, even if the business fell short of my goals.
I built, coded, designed, documented, marketed, and ran Placemark. It had paying
customers who used it for real-world purposes. It shipped, and it was a real business.
With luck, it’ll become something as an open source project – either maintained,
or used as inspiration and fuel for future projects. I’m happy to create more
value than I capture.
There’s more to write about what I learned, but for now I just want to say
thanks to everyone who gave it a shot, and all of the people who were
supportive along the way - special thanks to
Gabriel Coch, Aaron Boodman,
Brian Lovin, Adam Krebs,
Prerna Nadathur, and many others.]]></summary>

My Olympus XA-2 is
my default walking-around camera. I love it, but its age is showing
and I’m envious of the crisp photos that people get out of later-era
SLR film cameras. Thinking about getting a lightweight viewfinder
for my monstrous Nikon F, or buying something like a Nikon FM2.
There’s a paradox to this gear, though, and I don’t want to delude
myself into thinking that I’d use a slightly different camera more
when really the issue is that I’m not shooting many photos regardless.

These were shot with SantaColor,
which produces the strong green & red channels. It’s interesting?
I chose not to “correct it” all the way back to natural lighting.
Or I couldn’t find a way to do that without ruining the look.

Getting film developed is harder than ever, but most major cities
have an option.
In New York, I use Gelatin and
Pink Folder Film House
In DC, I used Dodge Chrome
In San Francisco, I used Photoworks

I’m still using Capture One to manage my photos, which is expensive and vastly overkill but
really nice, focused, “pro” software.]]></summary>
