        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the main missing pieces for the Compose spec support in az containerapp compose was support for the build key.
 
With the 0.2.0 release, there is now support for the build key.  The container image build is handled by Azure Container Registry, so you can either provide ACR credentials or a new container registry will be created for you as part of the creation process.  Only context and dockerfile are currently supported.  
 
Example Compose File for a .NET Web Api project:
 
 
 
 
version: '3'
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./src
      dockerfile: ./TodoApi/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:80
 
 
 
 
Example Repository Layout:
 

 
Example Command:
 
 
 
cd dotnet_api
az group create --name dotnet_api_example --location eastus
az containerapp compose create \
            --environment dotnetaca \
            --resource-group dotnet_api_example

about a corner of web standards that’s pretty underdiscussed and underdocumented.
It’s odd enough that even MDN, the gospel
for web standards documentation, doesn’t mention it very often.
The thing is called user activation. It’s existed in a de-facto form for
years, but only recently earned itself a web standard within the HTML spec.
The essence of user activation is that there are certain APIs that do disruptive
or annoying things like opening pop-up windows or saving a file that shouldn’t be
callable arbitrarily. Classically, it’s annoying to open a browser window and
get a pop-up ad.
To crack down on pop-up ads and other annoyances, browsers implemented restrictions
to these APIs, mostly in the form of tying them to the “click” ev…]]></summary>

For context, webcams are mostly bad. Even companies that make great cameras,
like Apple, make terrible webcams. Nobody understands how Apple’s webcams
are so bad, even in new products.
The webcams that Wirecutter recommends are awful.
You don’t have to care about webcam quality, because the bar is so low.
But I’ve always cared for images and lighting, and I’ve been recording

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.]]></summary>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they'd been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.]]></summary>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is estimated that about one in four adults worldwide has an abnormal build-up of fat in the liver, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD can lead to permanent liver damage, and heart disease is the leading cause of death in people with fatty liver disease. Because NAFLD is often missed in routine medical screening, the new scientific statement raises awareness and understanding about its link to heart disease and to outline how to prevent and diagnose the condition.]]></summary>
