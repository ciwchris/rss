Considering the distributed nature of microservices, you need to account for failures, retries, and timeouts in a system composed of microservices. While Container Apps features the building blocks for running microservices, use of Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) provides an even richer microservices programming model.
 
Azure Container Apps offers a fully managed version of the Dapr APIs when building microservices. When you use Dapr in Azure Container Apps, you can enable sidecars to run next to your microservices that provide a rich set of capabilities. Available Dapr APIs include Service to Service calls, Pub/Sub, Event Bindings, State …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a little yearly round-up over on Placemark.
I’m not one for concrete resolutions or nostalgia, so on with the usual, a Recently.
Reading
I read Policing the Open Road
on Rebecca’s suggestion. It’s an incredible book that I’ll
probably re-read soon, because the central conflict that it sets out feels so thoroughly
deadlocked, unresolvable, and important - the interplay between privacy, safety, police
power, and freedom.
I don’t agree with all of it, but Jon McLoone’s explanatio of why Wolfram is not open source
resonated strongly with me. Placemark, as I’ve said before, is not planning on being
open source, though components of the application will be released. Some of my reasoning
lines up with Wolfram’s pretty precisely. The central piece for me, I think, is just
what the community means - where communities come from, how they agree on what they
do, how they collect and disperse. Magical thinking around what constitutes
community and how it operates is my biggest gripe about open source ideology in this
day and age: too many people happily ignore the top-heaviness of some communities,
or don’t think about where the direction, leadership, contributions, and standards
come from.
Watching

Watch Vampire’s Kiss. That is all.
Expect to see in the new year: more, probably shorter, blog posts. More photos.
And Placemark, out in the wild.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog will demonstrate on how to connect Azure SQL database from Python Function App using managed identity or access token. If you are looking for how to implement it in Windows App Service, you may refer to this post: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-connect-azure-sql-database-from-azure-app-service-windows/ba-p/2873397.
Note that Azure Active Directory managed identity authentication method was added in ODBC Driver since version 17.3.1.1 for both system-assigned and user-assigned identities. In Azure blessed image for Python Function, the ODBC Driver version is 17.8. Which makes it possible to leverage this feature in Linux App Service.

Briefly, this post will provide you a step to step guidance with sample code and introduction on the authentication…]]></summary>

You can secure communications end-to-end or terminate transport-level security at any communication point for Spring Boot apps. You can also automate the provisioning and configuration for all the Azure resources needed for securing communications.
 
Implementing secure communications as part of your solution architecture can be challenging. Many customers manually rotate their certificates or create their own solutions to automate provisioning and configuration. Even then, there is still data exfiltration risk – say unauthorized copying or transfer of data from server systems. With Azure Spring Cloud, all of this is handled …]]></summary>
