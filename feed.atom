Let’s take a look.
 
What does it take to run an app on Kubernetes?
If you think about it, if you start from a source code of an application, say a microservice, that you want to run on Kubernetes, there are a number of steps and prerequisites:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Move app service resources across subscriptions
Many customers try to migrate across subscriptions, resource groups, and so on. Sometimes they use uploaded certificates in the App service instead of ASC.This blog will be helpful when they migrate App service resources with uploaded certificates. I wrote this blog for testing based on Azure docs.
 
See move across subscriptions 

 
Testing Steps
1. Prerequisites
2. Upload and bind certificates to App Service
3. Do the migration
4. Validate the result
 
1. Prerequisites
- App Service- App service domain: in my case, tlsmigrationtest.com- Add a custom domain to App Service: SSL isn't bound yet

 
2. Upload and bind certificates
Upload certificate (.pfx) and bind certificate to the app service domain.
A. App service > TLS/SSL settings > Private Key Certificates (.pfx) > Upload Certificate

 
B. Upload the certificate

C. Bind certificates
App Service > Custom domains > Add bindings

 
After finishing the above steps, you can see the SSL binding to the App Service domain.

 
3. Migration across subscriptions with uploaded certificates
A. For migration, go to your resource group.
 
B. Before moving resources you must click "show hidden types"
When you check "show hidden types", you can see uploaded certificates.

 
C. Check all App service resources and click move to another subscription
You must move all App Service resources together such as App Service, App service domain, and certificates.
Check limitation Move Azure App Service resources across resource groups or subscriptions - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn

 
D. Validate the result
Before you migrate app service resources, you can see the validation status.
If you can see succeeded status like below, you will be able to migrate successfully.

 
4. Success migration
Uploaded app service certificates are still bound to the App Service domain in the new subscription.]]></summary>

So you're building serverless applications with Microsoft Azure Functions, but you need to persist data to a database. What do you do about controlling the number of concurrent connections to your database from the function? What happens if the function currently connected to your database shuts down or a new instance comes online to scale with demand?
 
The concept of serverless in general, whether that be through a function or database, is great because it is designed for the modern application. Applications that scale on-demand reduce the maintenance overhead and applications that are pay as you go reduce unnecessary costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service on Linux images using PHP 8.x are now bundled with NGINX instead of Apache. The use of .htaccess files will not work for NGINX as these are used for Apache only. This will require the need to setup a custom startup script and modifying the existing NGINX site configuration.
 

 
Navigate to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Development Tools section, select SSH then Go -->.
Modifying the default site config
You will want to make a copy of the existing configuration and place the file inside the /home/site directory.
 


cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /home/site/default


Once you created a default page as in the previous step, please update the location block to add HSTS Header and create the custom startup script as mentioned below
  
location / {           
index  index.php index.html index.htm hostingstart.html;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
}
Creating the custom startup script
You will now need to create a custom startup script and save the file as /home/site/startup.sh



#!/bin/bash

cp /home/site/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
service nginx reload


In the custom startup script, we are doing the following:

Overriding the existing /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file with the /home/site/default file.
Reloading the NGINX service to make the updates take effect.

Updating the application settings
Navigate back to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Settings section, select Configuration.
Go over to the General Settings section of the Configuration blade.
For the Startup Command enter the following: /home/site/startup.sh
Save these settings and navigate to your application https://{sitename}.azurewebsites.net/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a function app, usually we use appsetting AzureWebJobsStorage to connect to storage. This blog shows you how to configure a function app using Azure Active Directory identities instead of secrets or connection strings, where possible. Using identities helps you avoid accidentally leaking sensitive secrets and can provide better visibility into how data is accessed.
 
This will not work if the storage account is in a sovereign cloud or has a custom DNS.
 
Below are the steps to do configuration.
 
1. Enable system assigned identity in your function app and save it.

 
2. Give storage access to your function app. Search for Storage Blob Data Owner, select it.

 
 

 

 
 
 
3. If you configure a blob-triggered function app, repeat the step 2 to add Storage Account Contributor and Storage Queue Data Contributor roles which will be used for blob trigger.

 

 
 
4. Return to Access Control (IAM), click Role assignments, search for your function app name to confirm the roles are added successfully.

 
 
5. Navigate to your function app. Select Configuration and edit AzureWebJobsStorage. Change the name to AzureWebJobsStorage__accountname.  Change the value to your storage account name. (The new setting uses a double underscore (__), which is a special character in application settings.) 

 
 
6. Delete the previous AzureWebJobsStorage. Then you will find your function app still works fine.]]></summary>

We came across many uses cases wherein customers wished to do more with their JMeter scripts, like ability to manipulate variables, or to use logs to debug the conditions. It is almost possible to achieve many of the use cases through the commonly available JMeter elements and augment them with the rich source of plugins available. There may be instances wherein it would be required for the test authors to script in order to manipulate the data before or after it is passed to samplers.
 
This blog will highlight steps on how to retrieve a user id from a JSON response and then pass it to the next request to fetch the details of a user. The details would be displayed on the log. This is a very common use case wherein it would be required…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our ISV partners have been asking for a way to provide an easy way to package their Kubernetes based solutions into the Marketplace and we're excited to announce K8s Apps to meet their needs.
 
ISV's are excited about this because it allows them to transact their offers in the Azure Marketplace via CI/CD.  This includes 48 hour publishing turnaround, automated security vetting and a self-service experience.  Customers look forward to the easy deployment, automated patching and using these offers to decrement their MACC.
 
Since then, a lot of information has come out and our partners are looking for guidance on how to get started.  I've recorded this End-To-End video which walks through the steps of an ISV Creating and Publishing an Offer as well as a Customer Purchasing the offer.  This is a more detailed version of the demo seen at Ignite.
 



 
 
All of the code available for the Minecraft As A Service demo is on GitHub.
 
If you are an ISV and interested in getting started in the K8s Apps in the Marketplace, I recommend the following:
 

Read the blog for the Ignite Announcement
Watch the full demo video
Fill out the Public Preview Invite Form
Attend the Mastering Container Offers Workshop

 
When you're ready to publish your offer to the marketplace, these docs will guide you:

Create the Offer
Prepare your Technical Assets
Create/Publish offer in Partner Center
Deploy the Offer

Come join some of our other partners that have already taken the leap!

Tetrate Istio Distro
Elastic Cloud

I hope this helps you on your journey into K8s Apps on the Azure Marketplace and we'll see your offer available for customers soon.]]></summary>

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.]]></summary>

Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the search for eternal youth, fecal transplants may seem like an unlikely way to reverse the aging process. However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>
