Â 
.NET 8 option for the in-process model
Since our last post, we have released support for .NET 8 on the in-process model! Apps already using .NET 6 on the in-process model can move to .NET 8 by following the steps in the updating to target .NET 8 on the in-process model guidance.
Â 
Please keep in mind that support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026, and youâ€™ll want to begin planning your migration to the isolated worker model in advance of that date.

.NET 9 (Preview)
The isolated worker model now supports .NET 9 as a Preview on Linux, starting with .NET 9â€¦]]></summary>

A frequent issue developers face is handling secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys needed for secure communication between services. Managed identities remove the necessity for developers to oversee these credentials.

Azure offers a robust environment tailored for enhancing .NET applications, providing seamless integration with GitHub Copilot and various cloud services. Visual Studio simplifies deploying .NET apps to Azure, making it easy to manage web apps, microservices, and serverless functions using Azure's powerful cloud infrastructure.

AÂ functionÂ transforms input to output, making it a lightweight choice for scheduled tasks, reminders, order processing and other actions that donâ€™t require fault tolerance more complex than simple retries. Plus, functions run on a cloud hostâ€™s infrastructure, scaling in and out on demand, and you only pay for the resources you consume.
Â 
But what if you have workflows that need more reliability and fault tolerance than a short-lived function provides? What if your scenario includes longer-running tasks or your business logic needs the output of one function as the input to another?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my previous blog posts of containerising .NET apps and Function apps, I discussed how to containerise .NET apps and Azure Functions apps with and without Dockerfile. However, deploying these containerised apps to Azure Container Apps (ACA) is a different story.
Â 
Since its release in May 2023, Azure Developer CLI (azd) has evolved significantly. azd nowadays even automatically generates Bicep files for us to immediately provision and deploy applications to Azure. With this feature, you only need the azd up command for provisioning and deployment.
Â 
Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to provision and deploy .NET apps including Azure Functions to ACA through just one command, azd up.

Getting this out of the door was quite a journey. We wrote a small blog post about it.

The Assistant video commercial
ðŸŽ¬ Drumroll, please... Our first video commercial celebrating the launch of The Assistant is live, and we couldnâ€™t be more thrilled and proud! Let us know what you think!
Check it out on YouTube!
Improvements and Bug Fixes (minor update post the Assistant launch)
You can now open the Kagi Search that the Assistant performed throughout all different thread responses.
Internet access is correctly set when the last used model is a Custom Assistant
When branching, earlier messages no longer disappear
Fixed an issue that disabled mouse scroll in the prompt box when large prompts were used
Fixed an issue where using Assistant bangs such as !code with another Custom Assistant present prevented the model selection from loading
While we finish implementing custom bangs for Custom Assistants, you can already create them manually by using the profile query parameter in the Assistant URL. For example: https://kagi.com/assistant?q=%s&profile=id

Since last time, I read a few books: Sea of Tranquility, a book club book, Doppelganger, the new Naomi Klein, and Manywhere, a collection of short stories.
Sea of Tranquility was very digestible sci-fi. I havenâ€™t read that much sci-fi overall, so itâ€™s probably inaccurate to say that itâ€™s spiritually similar to Ted Chiang, but thatâ€™s the closest reference I know of. In the end, I think itâ€™s a little empty - the book shows off a lot of complexity but doesnâ€™t really deliver on it and things conclude in a way thatâ€™s a bit too cute. That said, it was a perfect book to read in a few days and discuss with a friendly group.
Doppelganger, I found kind of annoying. I agree with Naomi Klein on nearly everything, including all of her thoughts in the book, and I think sheâ€™s a very cool person, â€¦]]></summary>

Read all about it in Announcing the Assistant blog post.
This update replaces the Beta version introduced nearly a year ago. It includes many new features, and we are working hard to bring back a few missing ones from the Beta, notably file upload, as soon as possible. You can still access the "old" assistant during the transition period using this link.
We also want to take this opportunity to extend a big thank you to our community, especially to our distinguished members and contributors, for all the feedback and testing that helped us create a better product.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we are aware, Azure Files currently does not support identity-based connections. This means that even if we can use identity-based host connections to replace the AzureWebjobsStorage, which uses a SAS token, we still cannot remove the file share connection strings (WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING) that also rely on a SAS token. Therefore, we are unable to disable the SAS token in the storage account.
Â 
For now, when creating function apps in the consumption/EP plan, we have the option to create an app without Azure File. In this scenario, we can bypass the SAS token requirement for Azure Files and solely utilize managed identity to access the storage account.

Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how Azure Functions apps can be containerised both with and without Dockerfile.

Previously, ARO clusters were limited to 62 worker nodes due to having only one IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with the cluster's load balancer. By enabling multiple IP addresses for the load balancer, we have removed this bottleneck, offering organizations greater flexibility in expanding their deployments.
