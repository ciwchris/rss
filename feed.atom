        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers describe a novel form of gene regulation that is altered in bladder cancer, leading to the boosting of a gene pathway that helps the cancer cells survive during rapid growth. The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.]]></summary>

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they'd been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.]]></summary>

The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population's increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the search for eternal youth, fecal transplants may seem like an unlikely way to reverse the aging process. However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

The symptom might include that after restarting the web app for a few hours, a percentage of the total requests (e.g. 1/3) get no response from the web server and timeout after 230 seconds. 230 seconds is the Azure default timeout value. The web app's memory usage may be observed to grow continuously since the issue starts.

But there’s a real danger of going too far down the wrong road with these things.
What I learned was a great mix of confirmations - that what I’m building is useful - and surprises, about what’s important and what troubles people run into.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As developers, we love the benefits of containers, but they're not always easy to deploy. It can be a cumbersome process to build a container image, push it to a registry, and then set up infrastructure and deploy the container.
 
Azure Container Apps is a modern, fully-managed, serverless platform for running containers. While we don't have to manage infrastructure, it's still up to us to figure out how to build our container image and deploy it.
 
Today, we're introducing a preview feature in the Azure CLI that streamlines the process of deploying to Azure Container Apps in a single command. Whether your source code is on your local machine or in GitHub, "az containerapp up" is the only command you need to get your app running in Azure Container Apps.
 
How does it work?

First, what is GitOps? Is it the same as DevOps? I'm so glad you asked. Let's begin with a refresher on what DevOps is:
 
"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users." ~ Donovan Brown
 
Donovan puts it best - DevOps is a combination of several key factors: people, process, and products - but it starts with people. Getting started with DevOps involves a cultural shift, which means it's so much more than buzz words like agile, continuous integration, continuous deployment, automation, etc. While those buzz words have their place and are needed, truly embracing DevOps means creating a DevOps culture between your engineering teams - this includes developers, operations, security, and beyond.

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>

Azure Spring Cloud platform provides AppPlatformIngressLogs to query Ingress request log for those Apps with endpoint enabled.
But for the Apps with endpoint disabled, since the traffic is not going through the platform load balancer, the ingress request log is not recorded. For such cases, to monitor the App access log, we can use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like Application Insights.
 
In this blog, let's demonstrate how to use AppPlatformIngressLogs and Application Insights to monitor both types of request access log.

System-assigned Identity
User-assigned Identity

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.
 
Before talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss "what is web.xml"?
 
Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.
 
The default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.
 
When tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. 
 
It instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.
There you specify:

what servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to
listeners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)
configuration parameters (context-params)
error pages, welcome files
security constraints

Back to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:

 
To add a custom error page, please follow below steps:

Add <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page "error.html" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use "/error.html" in <location></location>.



Add your custom error in webapps folder.



Build and re-deploy the project to App Service.
Now you will see the custom error page replace the default one.


 
Please kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.]]></summary>

The idea of individuals contributing streetview-like imagery with a dashcam is not new. Mapillary did exactly that starting in 2013, established a large dataset and active community in a few years, and sold to Facebook in 2020.
