ALS and FTD are two neurodegenerative disorders in which many cases are linked by mislocalization of TDP-43, where instead of being primarily located in the nucleus of the cell where genes are activated, it forms aggregates outside the nucleus in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Rare mutations in the TDP-43 gene are known to cause ALS, but almost all cases of ALS show mislocalization of TDP-43.]]></summary>

One of them is that you are asked to generate the OpenAPI document from the function app right after the build and integrate it with Power Platform or Azure API Management.

Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to generate the OpenAPI document within the GitHub Actions workflow right after the function app build.
 

NOTE: Let's use the sample app provided by the Azure Functions OpenAPI Extension repository.

 
First of all, you need to install the Azure Functions Core Tools within your GitHub Actions workflow. Installing the tool varies depending on the runner OS. The command…]]></summary>

In this tutorial, you learn to:

Set up an Azure Static Web Apps site for a Vanilla Basic app.
Create an GitLab Pipeline to build and publish a static web app via Azure portal.

 
Prerequisites

Active Azure account: If you don't have one, you can create an account for free.
GitLab project: If you don't have one, you can create a project for free.
You’ll need to validate your account with a credit card. This is required to discourage and reduce abuse on GitLab infrastructure.

 
Create a repository in GitLab

Navigate to your repository in GitLab Repos.
Go to create new project page.
Click on Import Project.

This blog walks you through the process of creating a Java WebSocket sample application in both Windows and Linux App Service.
 
We will use a simple Java Spring Boot Websocket sample to build a server that accepts a message that carries a user’s name. In response, the server will push a greeting into a queue to which the client is subscribed.
 

 
Prerequisite

Azure account with an active subscription
JDK 1.8 or later
Maven 3.2+
Git client

 
Build & Test the Java Spring Boot Websocket Service

For many years, scientists have assumed that the loss of connections between brain cells caused Alzheimer's-related symptoms, including memory loss, but actual evidence of the role of synaptic loss had been limited to a small number of brain biopsies and post-mortem brain exams conducted on patients with moderate or advanced disease. However, the emergence of a positron emission tomography (PET) scanning technology has allowed researchers to observe the loss of synapses in living patients with even mild symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.]]></summary>

So for this post we're going to address that as we take a look at logging using the Azure Application Insights platform (often referred to as AppInsights).
If you're deploying into Azure in the ways that we've looked at in this series, chances are you're already using AppInsights, as it's the cornerstone of Azure's monitoring platform, so let's look at how to get better insights out of our GraphQL server.

If you're new to GraphQL on Azure, I'd encourage you to check out part 3 in which I go over how we can create a GraphQL server using Apollo and deploy that to an Azure Function, which is the process we'll be using for this post.
