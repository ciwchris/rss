This approach allows you to have full flexibility over your database calls but building out such a backend can be tedious and complex, especially when considering the edge cases of a data-access backend such as authorization and relationships. With Static Web Apps’ database connections feature, and its underlying open-source project Data API Builder, you now have more options to build out database-backed web applications. In this blog article, we cover the considerations of choosing between these various options.

MongoDB Atlas and Azure are great friends! In fact, they became even better friends recently with the addition of the MongoDB Atlas Pas-as-You-Go Software as a Service (SaaS) subscription to the Azure Marketplace, allowing you to use your existing Azure credits to enjoy all the benefits of the MongoDB Atlas Developer Data Platform. So there is no better time to learn how you can take advantage of both of these.
 
In this article, we are going to see how you can deploy a MERN stack application to Azure Web Apps, part of Azure App Service, in a few simple steps. By the end of this, you will have your own version of the website that can be found here.

One of the best ways to do this is by collecting a network trace. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the process of collecting a network trace on Azure Container App using the `tcpdump` tool.
 
Step 1: Accessing the Azure Container App Console
To access the Azure Container App Console, navigate to your container app in the Azure Portal. Once you've selected your container app, click on the "Console" option under the "Monitoring" blade. This will open up a terminal window in your browser that you can use to connect to your container.

In this post, I'll walk you through the steps involved, which include:

creating an "azure.yaml" file via `azd init`
adding a "main.parameters.json" file
properly tagging your resource group and resources with `azd-env-name`
for deployment targets, add the corresponding `azd-service-name` tag as defined in "azure.yaml"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are launching a new way to pay for Azure Spring Apps -- the consumption pricing plan. This plan is now in public preview so you can start creating and deploying apps today. This new plan is super-efficient because you can start from zero and scale to zero vCPU.  You get more straightforward pricing across your containerized applications since it costs the same as Azure Container Apps, but with added value for Spring apps.
 
How does this work? With the new plan, you can deploy apps that don’t need to run all the time or apps that have bursts of traffic and only pay for the resources used. This is a “serverless plan”, which means your apps can scale out and in automatically depending on the number of HTTP requests or events they receive or simply run as always-on background jobs.

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code on-demand without having to manage infrastructure. It supports various types of triggers, including HTTP triggers, which allow you to expose your function as a RESTful API.
However, while working with Azure Function HTTP triggers, you may encounter a 404 error, which indicates that the requested resource was not found.
In this blog, we will learn the possible causes of the Azure Function HTTP trigger 404 error, along with examples to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

So let's jump in and learn about how to use SWA Data Connections with Blazor.
Oh, and for something different, let's try also use a SQL backend rather than Cosmos DB.
Setting up DAB
When we've looked at DAB so far, we've had to create two files, a config for DAB and a GraphQL schema containing the types. Well since we're using SQL this time we can drop the GraphQL schema file, as DAB will use the SQL schema to generate the types, something it couldn't do fro…]]></summary>

In case you do not have an existing App Service and Azure Database for MySQL setup, you can follow this blog: Tutorial: PHP app with MySQL - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn.


This setup will create a VNET and MySQL database where the MySQL access will be locked down and not exposed to the public internet, which is compliant with recommended best practices for security.


To migrate your PHP code to Azure App Service, we can use one of the deployment methods such as Zip Deploy: Run your app from a ZIP package - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn

Sometimes the low-rated reviews are based on delivery, packaging... whereas a few high-rated reviews might be on cost but not on quality. Generally, reviews/ratings are displayed without any context which results in customers needing additional time and effort to get the most value out of it. Hence, we built this prototype using Azure Open AI to present the consolidated information from all the reviews of a product.
 

 
We fed all the reviews of a specific product to GPT-3 text-davinci-003 model with a prompt to classify the text based on the three categories – Cost, Quality, and Delivery. Prompt is where user provide the English text command which the API endpoint of the model will use to generate the complet…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce the release of Storage Explorer 1.28.0 that will help enhance our developer’s experience while accessing a variety of storage services!
 
Storage Explorer 1.28.0:
 
Storage Explorer strives to make it easy for developers to quickly access and manage many storage services under different accounts. After analyzing customer research and telemetry, version 1.28.0 will include new updates/features that will benefit our developers’ journey.
 
To highlight a few features, the Storage Explorer 1.28.0 now allows for Text preview enhancements and downloading multiple blobs at once when filtering based on a tag:
 

 
 

Text Preview Enhancements

Additional content-types have been added to the built in list of content-types which can be text previewed. These include: - text/xml - application/xml - application/json
You can now preview files of any size, but only the first 10MB of the file. You can download the file and open it in your default text editor to view the entire file. A status bar will appear at the top of the preview tab that informs you of files greater than 10MB


Multi Blob Download When Filtering by Tags

When filtering by tags, you can now download multiple blobs at once by clicking the Download in either the context menu or toolbar of the blob



 
Other features in this update include:

SAS Expiration Warnings
Trust File Extension During Open
Copy Between Blob Containers and File Shares
Filter by Prefix in ADLS Gen2 Blob Containers
Sub-Directory Prefix Search in File Shares
Copy Tables with Azure AD Credentials
Preserving of Blob Tags During Clone
Lease Operations on ADLS Gen2 Folders
ADLS Gen2 Soft Delete Feature Flag Removed]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As we know, we can link existing Azure function app to Azure static web app. After that, the Azure Functions app will be mapped to the /api route of your static web app.
 
In the following example, function app tonytesthttp has been linked to static web app.
 

 
When we try to access the function app outside static webapp, we will encounter Bad Request error. We understand that the static web app must do something to block the request. We can try to unlink the function app from static web app. However, you will find the function app still encounters the same error. How can we make our function app back to normal?
 

 
If you read the official document (Bring your own functions to Azure Static Web Apps | Microsoft Learn) carefully, you will find following statement.
 
If authentication and authorization policies aren't already set up on your existing Functions app, then the static web app has exclusive access to the API. To make your Functions app accessible to other applications, add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.
 
It seems that the link operation will add authentication limitation to only allow static webapp to access the function app. If you navigate to the authentication setting of the function app, you will find the static webapp was added as an identity provider. Even we unlink the function app to static webapp, the identity provider will not be removed automatically. We need to remove the identity provider manually. After that, the function app will work again.]]></summary>

 Although WordPress is an excellent content management system (CMS), it isn’t without its issues. Sometimes its admin panel can be laggy, preventing you from easily managing your website. We have always made sure that WordPress on Azure App Service meets the performance requirements of our customers. However, we got to learn from customer feedback that we could do better for the admin persona. So we have enhanced the offering with accelerated performance for admin pages.

late to the Recently, because I’ve been pretty busy! Things
are good. Building products is fun but also a lot of work.
Pretty excited about what I’m working on. Ready for winter to
end.
Reading
I enjoyed reading Ross Barkan’s What to Do About Police,
though it’s bound to generate some controversy. Barkan is,
I think, a geniunely ‘center’ or balanced commentator, if you
consider the political spectrum of major American cities as the
guide. He also has a sense for reading polls and knowing people
enough to identify surprising but true disconnects between what
we think people believe and what they do.
There’s a strangely libertarian tinge to the leftist arguments around defunding and abolishing the police. The NYPD budget is described as “bl…]]></summary>

Authentication is the process of verifying client or server identity before accessing resources to protect information security. Azure App Service provides sets of authentication technologies to protect and secure your web application. However, it is a steep learning curve to know all of them, and we often get lost in the details of the documentations. The purpose of the article is to give you an intuitive way to understand the authentication features in App Service and a high-level summary of different authentication models, their usage scenarios and useful links.

There is a symptom with low throughput in Service Bus triggered function due to Service Bus's message session enabled. This blog we're going to do a lab to demonstrate the cause and effect of this situation.
 
Common causes:
According to session features description (Azure Service Bus message sessions - Azure Service Bus | Microsoft Learn), since a session receiver is created by a client accepting a session. When the session is accepted and held by a client, the client holds an exclusive lock on all messages with that session's session ID in the queue or subscription. It will also hold exclusive locks on all messages with the session ID that will arrive later.

Hence, if all the messages are with same session id, there is only one receiver can consume these messages one by one…]]></summary>
