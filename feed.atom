Frontend web applications often rely on dynamic content retrieved from APIs. Azure Static Web Apps supports seamless integration with Azure Functions to create serverless HTTP APIs. Azure Functions is one of several popular options for hosting APIs on Azure. Today, we’re excited to announce Azure Static Web Apps has added preview support for integrating APIs in the following Azure services:
 

Azure App Service – host APIs built with frameworks like Flask, Express, Apollo, and ASP.NET
Azure Container Apps – integrate with APIs and microservices running in serverless containers
Azure API Management – aggregate multiple APIs in a unified API gateway

With this release, Durable Functions now supports .NET, Node.js, Python, PowerShell, and finally Java running on Azure Functions. In this post, I'll give a brief tour of Durable Functions for Java to highlight some of the capabilities and differences compared to other languages.
 
If this is your first time learning about Azure Durable Functions, I definitely recommend reading through the Durable Functions overview content first.

After working through some getting started experiences in the preview with a couple of my teammates, both of them expressed the idea that a docker-compose file should provide enough information to create an Azure Container Apps environment and microservices deployment.  The Compose specification is open source and has been used to create a variety of tools to support other deployment options, so I thought it’d be worth a try.

By enabling dynamic concurrency, the platform can adjust the concurrency of functions dynamically in the condition that the worker instance is healthy(like CPU and thread utilization is healthy). You can refer to more information about dynamic concurrency in this link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-concurrency#dynamic-concurrency.
 
In this blog, I am writing to introduce how DC works in Azure function apps with some tests.

Therefore, you should follow an authentication and authorisation process to use the API unless it's the public API. Those authentication/authorisation process uses either 1) an auth key or 2) an access token through an OAuth process.
 
Using the auth key approach, you can store it in a safe place like the Azure Key Vault service and fetch the key. It's a relatively simple process. However, if you need to use the OAuth process, it gets complicated with the following authorisation process. Here's the conceptual OAuth process.

What is APIM Authorizations
Before we dive into creating the application, let's quickly look at what this feature is.
 
In a connected system, being able to communicate between different Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms is a common task, but often these platforms will use OAuth2 to verify the user identity. This requires undertaking an authentication flow, which is fine if you're directly using the system, but what if it's being handled by a background job, like an Azure Function running with a Timer Trigger?

Getting started with Azure Load Testing has never been easier. You can now create a test without prior knowledge of testing tools by entering a URL on the Azure portal. You can set up, run, and test a URL in less than 5 minutes.
 
Run a quick test

Create an Azure Load Testing resource. You can use an existing resource if you have one.
Once it is created, navigate to the resource overview page.
In the Get started tab, click on Quick test.
Enter the URL you want to test.
Optionally, you can change any of the load parameters like number of virtual users, test duration, and ramp-up time.
Click on Run test.

Congrats! You have created and run a load test for your web application. You can modify the test parameters or extend the test by downloading and editing the JMeter script. Learn more about quick tests here. 
 
Once you are done exploring Azure Load Testing, you will want to delete your resource to avoid ongoing billing.
 
For more details on Azure Load Testing, check out the preview documentation. Learn more about pricing details on our Azure Load Testing pricing page.

There are two version of Azure MySQL server :  Azure MySQL single Server and Azure MySQL Flexible Server.

To try out it out, install durable-functions 2.0.0 (or a later minor/patch release) from npm. 
 
Note: This is a breaking change release, so make sure to check that your applications are not affected by any of the modified APIs. That said, we have only changed edge-case behaviors that we believe should not affect most apps. 
 
Durable Functions (DF) makes it easy to implement robust stateful services that make full use of the scaling and billing benefits of serverless, all while using your language of choice: C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and PowerShell. 
 
As DF makes its way into more languages, we’ve been working on ways to optimize each programming language’s SDK to be as performant as possible. …]]></summary>

More importantly, I got a lot of feedback about what would make it more
useful, and implemented a bunch of that, which I think has already improved
the product.
But, the list is long and every night I go to bed wishing that Placemark
just supported vertex-snapping already. I’ll hopefully get to those
things before the requesters run out of patience with me. At this point,
my approach is just to advance the product. There’s some momentum, and there’s
some information about what’s important for users, and the best strategy
is to sprint toward that. I think.

I build Placemark, a map data editor. Placemark supports a lot of file formats - not all, but a good handful of the vector data formats for geospatial data.
I recently added support for FlatGeobuf, a really neat format that can store basically the same stuff as GeoJSON, but it produces much smaller files, includes a tree index so that you can search for geospatial data within a buffer, and supports random access by storing offsets to data in the file.

The thing about retaining logs is that the storage requirements can get big. REALLY big.
 
One of the most common log search and indexing tools is ElasticSearch. ElasticSearch is exceptionally good at finding a needle in the haystack (e.g. When did the string "Error message #123" occur in any copy of application X on March 17th). It does this by indexing the contents of the log message which can significantly increase your storage consumption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2019, we’ve expanded the capabilities of Azure Spring Cloud, including the Enterprise tier we announced in preview at SpringOne in 2021.  Azure Spring Cloud is a fully featured platform for all types of Spring applications, and to better reflect this we’re now calling the service Azure Spring Apps. 
 
We’ve created new versions for Azure CLI, as well as new plugins for Maven, IntelliJ and VS Code. Existing versions will continue to operate in deprecation mode.  
You’ll see this change is already reflected in the Azure portal, Azure CLI, API, Azure marketplace, and VMware Tanzu product descriptions.  The name has already been updated in Microsoft Docs, but you will continue to see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams. 
Changes in the Azure billing meter description, Powershell, Github actions, Azure DevOps task and Nubesgen will take place in upcoming weeks.  
As introducing the name change in Terraform unavoidably interrupts existing behavior, we’re still in the process of evaluating whether we’ll change the name in Terraform.  
 
Action recommended 

Upgrade to the new version of Azure CLI with
az extension add -n spring
You can optionally remove the old extension using 
az extension remove -n spring-cloud 

Upgrade plugins for Maven , IntelliJ and VS Code.]]></summary>

This goes under the assumption of a growing world population's increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the search for eternal youth, fecal transplants may seem like an unlikely way to reverse the aging process. However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>
