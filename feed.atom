In previous post, we have enabled our PowerApps to access your Web APIs via API Management. We should enable Developer Portal on Azure API Management to publish your Web API for "citizen developers" widely as next step.

No.1: Setup Power Apps "custom connectors" to simply call your Web APIs via API Management 
No.2: Enable Developer portal for API Management to expose your Web APIs as ecosystem - this post!
No.3: Authentication and authorization with Azure AD

So for this post we're going to address that as we take a look at logging using the Azure Application Insights platform (often referred to as AppInsights).
If you're deploying into Azure in the ways that we've looked at in this series, chances are you're already using AppInsights, as it's the cornerstone of Azure's monitoring platform, so let's look at how to get better insights out of our GraphQL server.
Side note: There's a lot more you can do with AppInsights in monitoring your infrastructure, monitoring across resources…]]></summary>

For the post, we'll use the Apollo Server and Azure Static Web Apps for hosting the API, mainly because SWA provides security (and if you're wondering, this is how I came across the need to write this recent post).
If you're new to GraphQL on Azure, I'd encourage you to check out part 3 in which I go over how we can create a GraphQL server using Apollo and deploy that to an Azure Function, which is the process we'll be using for this post.

Last year my colleague Justin Yoo released an extension for .NET Azure Functions to generate OpenAPI definitions and not long afterwards he reached out to me on whether it'd be possible to do something similar for JavaScript/TypeScript Functions.
Well, good news, I've created a npm package to do that, which you can find on GitHub and in this post we'll take a look at how to use it.
How it works
This npm package works conceptually similar to the .NET one in that you annotate the Function handler to provide OpenAPI schema information. This is done using a wrapper, or higher order, function, which takes a JavaScript object in that represents the schema for OpenAPI.

At Ignite, we announced Azure Container Apps, a serverless application-centric hosting service that enables users to quickly deploy containerized applications and microservices to Azure without the need to configure and manage underlying infrastructure resources or container orchestrators. Azure Container Apps runs on  Azure Kubernetes Service, and includes several open-source projects: Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA), Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), and Envoy. This open-source foundation enables teams to build and run portable applications powered by Kubernetes and open standards without the operational overhead and management complexity of working with the platform directly.

This article only discuss the Windows Azure App Service, Linux App Service is out of scope of this article. 

 
What happened? 

The Windows Azure App Service platform removed some minor NodeJS version. That could result in some un-expected result if the App Service's configuration is not right. 

 
Is that removement is expected behavior? 

Yes.
Azure App Service is a PaaS service, and the platform will manage the Windows Node version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn
in January, and it radically reshaped my conception of local
politics and the general arc of city politics in the last 50 years.
Highly, highly recommended stuff.

Brian Lovin did a design crit of Placemark,
which has been powering a big burst of activity on that front.
The energy on Placemark is happening in two semi-parallel efforts:
knocking out the last few core concepts - layers and properties, mostly -
and running through this new, super-helpful list of ideas and
critiques from Brian. The last few days have been super, super
productive as a result, to the extent that I’ll probably crash
and take a few days off in a little bit. But for now, I’ve
got energy and direction, and I’ve got to ride it.

Reading
This paper on Ethnographic Research on Dynamicland
resonated with me. You can read a lot about the technology
and business of these sorts of efforts, but rarely is there
someone looking for the human interactions, and Dynamicland
is one of the most unusual and ambitious projects out there.
Bachmann doesn’t editorialize much, but I think some
themes emerge, like the tension between “brainstorming”/collaboration versus
authority and vision.
It reminded me of The Idea Factory,
that great book about Bell Labs. Research labs are this odd thing -
part of what made Bell Labs great was the ability to work on a slightly
longer timeline, with fewer limitations on what you created. But
that ability was directly a result of the government’s explicit
permittance of AT&T Bell as a monopoly, during that period of time.
Listening
Townes Van Zandt by Townes Van Zandt

Been on a Townes Van Zandt kick recently, sparked of course
by seeing If I Needed You
pop up in an episode of Patriot.


Almost every time I’m very productive, it coincides with a full listen-through
of the whole Joanna Newsom ouvre. There’s nothing like it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The huge success of Docker in energizing the tech community around containers has been truly amazing to see.  As containers are the foundation of Kubernetes, it goes hand in hand that Docker was a core part of the platform. As Kubernetes matured, and the needs of the community and our customers grew, the tight coupling of Docker to Kubernetes through dockershim (the interface between the Kubernetes platform and the Docker runtime) needed to evolve. On 2 December 2020, with the release of Kubernetes 1.20, Kubernetes announced it is deprecating Docker as a container runtime, through the use of dockershim, in a future release of Kubernetes.
 
With the upcoming Kubernetes 1.24 release, dockershim will be removed.
 
If you are using a supported Kubernetes version in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

For Linux node pools, there is no action required on your part. All supported Kubernetes versions on AKS use containerd as the default runtime for Kubernetes 1.19 and greater.
For Windows Server 2019 node pools, in January 2021, we announced the general availability of containerd as the default container runtime for Kubernetes 1.23 and greater. If you are using a cluster with a Kubernetes version prior to 1.23, you can create a new node pool with containerd enabled before the switch over to it being the default in 1.23 then move your pods to the new pool.

 
We work very closely with the community through our participation in the Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIG) from Storage, to Windows and everything in between and I'd like to thank both the community and our engineering teams for the work to get to this milestone.]]></summary>

You can seamlessly ship Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud logs and metrics into Elastic, instrument Spring Boot apps, and monitor every step of your cloud journey. And gain a holistic view across Spring Boot applications and other logs and metrics in your cloud and on-premises environments.
 
Over the past two years, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about the scenarios they face. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to aggregate logs and metrics from these applications and instrument them for application performance m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce the availability of the initial public preview of the App Service Environment (ASE) v3 migration tool. With this feature, you'll be able to migrate your existing ASE as well as the apps running on that ASE to ASEv3. ASEv3 provides a number of feature differences as well as performance enhancements and potential reduced overall costs compared to previous versions. To get a complete overview on ASEv3, read the ASEv3 focused App Service Environment overview.

Check out the following docs to learn more about migrating to ASEv3:

- Migrate to App Service Environment v3
- How to Migrate to ASEv3

Please note, at this time, the public preview supports a subset of possible ASE configurations. Be sure to review the supported scenarios to see if you can migrate at this time using the feature and stay tuned for updates as we release additional capabilities.

An Azure portal experience for migration will be available at the start of February, 2022. Be on the lookout for additional announcements.

If your ASE isn't supported for migration using the migration feature and your ASE isn't listed under one of the upcoming supported scenarios, you have the option to migrate to ASEv3 manually. See the migration alternatives for more details.]]></summary>
