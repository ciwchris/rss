        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Searching through application logs is a critical part of any operations team. And as the Cloud Native ecosystem grows and evolves, more modern approaches for this use case are emerging.
 
The thing about retaining logs is that the storage requirements can get big. REALLY big.
 
One of the most common log search and indexing tools is ElasticSearch. ElasticSearch is exceptionally good at finding a needle in the haystack (e.g. When did the string "Error message #123" occur in any copy of application X on March 17th). It does this by indexing the contents of the log message which can significantly increase your storage consumption.
 
The enthusiastic team at Grafana created Loki to address this problem. Instead of indexing the full log message, Loki only indexes the metadata (e.g. label, names…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2019, we’ve expanded the capabilities of Azure Spring Cloud, including the Enterprise tier we announced in preview at SpringOne in 2021.  Azure Spring Cloud is a fully featured platform for all types of Spring applications, and to better reflect this we’re now calling the service Azure Spring Apps. 
 
We’ve created new versions for Azure CLI, as well as new plugins for Maven, IntelliJ and VS Code. Existing versions will continue to operate in deprecation mode.  
You’ll see this change is already reflected in the Azure portal, Azure CLI, API, Azure marketplace, and VMware Tanzu product descriptions.  The name has already been updated in Microsoft Docs, but you will continue to see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams. 
Changes in the Azure billing meter description, Powershell, Github actions, Azure DevOps task and Nubesgen will take place in upcoming weeks.  
As introducing the name change in Terraform unavoidably interrupts existing behavior, we’re still in the process of evaluating whether we’ll change the name in Terraform.  
 
Action recommended 

Upgrade to the new version of Azure CLI with
az extension add -n spring
You can optionally remove the old extension using 
az extension remove -n spring-cloud 

Upgrade plugins for Maven , IntelliJ and VS Code.]]></summary>

Azure Static Web Apps recently introduced the ability to automatically configure an Azure DevOps pipeline to build and deploy your app. It's a great way to get your app up and running quickly.
 
For production applications, it's common to first deploy an app to staging environment(s) prior to deploying to production. In this article, we'll walk through how to configure a robust Azure DevOps pipeline that will:
 

Build an app, Azure Functions API, and Playwright tests
 Deploy the app to a staging environment
Automatically validate the staging app with the Playwright tests
Wait for a manual approval
Deploy your app to production

Azure Arc provides a simplified Governance and Management capability by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform.

Azure Arc-enabled data services allows us to run Azure data services like SQL Managed Instance or PostgreSQL Hyperscale (preview) anywhere using Kubernetes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Two days ago the wireplumber package was made to replace pipewire-media-session as the latter session manager for PipeWire is considered dead upstream and will see no more releases. Unfortunately, this step was premature.
Our pipewire audio packages (pipewire-alsa, pipewire-jack and pipewire-pulse) ship configuration that prompt media-session to activate PipeWire's audio features. When these packages are not installed and the configuration is missing, PipeWire can be used for screen recording without interfering with ALSA or PulseAudio.
WirePlumber disregards this mechanism and always configures PipeWire to grab audio devices, meaning users of PulseAudio or bare ALSA experience broken audio.
The replacement has been reverted while we attempt to look for a better solution switching to WirePlumber. If you are currently not using PipeWire for audio and wireplumber got installed on your system, please reinstall pipewire-media-session and reboot to restore audio functionality.
pacman -Syu pipewire-media-session]]></summary>

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.]]></summary>

Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health.

It is the second clinical trial to show that the drug, sodium selenate, may slow cognitive decline and neuro-degenerative damage that is the hallmark of many dementias including Alzheimer's Disease.]]></summary>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last thirteen days, after I opened the doors and let Placemark into the world, have been a blur. Mostly the good kind!
It came down to a question of whether the things I thought should be priorities were actually the priorities. I had a backlog that could easily have stretched a few more weeks into the future, and by the time I was done with those tasks I probably would have found some more that seemed like a priority. But there’s a real danger of going too far down the wrong road with these things.
What I learned was a great mix of confirmations - that what I’m building is useful - and surprises, about what’s important and what troubles people run into. Reacting and improving in response to those has been exciting. For quite a few emails, I was able to ship the feature or the fix befo…]]></summary>

Azure Container Apps is a modern, fully-managed, serverless platform for running containers. While we don't have to manage infrastructure, it's still up to us to figure out how to build our container image and deploy it.
 
Today, we're introducing a preview feature in the Azure CLI that streamlines the process of deploying to Azure Container Apps in a single command. Whether your source code is on your local machine or in GitHub, "az containerapp up" is the only command you need to get your app running in Azure Container Apps.
 
How does it work?

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is estimated that about one in four adults worldwide has an abnormal build-up of fat in the liver, called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD can lead to permanent liver damage, and heart disease is the leading cause of death in people with fatty liver disease. Because NAFLD is often missed in routine medical screening, the new scientific statement raises awareness and understanding about its link to heart disease and to outline how to prevent and diagnose the condition.]]></summary>
