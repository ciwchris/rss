        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just like any software, it is important that you keep your WordPress website and all underlying technology – PHP, NGINX, Linux, and MySQL, up to date. Reasons why you must keep your website up to date:
 

Security patches: Updates commonly contain security patches to ensure that any identified vulnerabilities are fixed. Older versions of WordPress or any underlying software makes it easy for bad actors to take advantage of known security vulnerabilities.
Bug fixes: Although all software undergoes multiple rounds of tests before release, some small bugs might go unnoticed. Developers fix these bugs when they are discovered and ship them via updates.
Performance enhancements: New updates also come with optimizations which increase performance. Ensuring the system is up to date can have signi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce Code-to-Cloud (preview), one of the fastest and easiest way to deploy and manage your web apps on Azure. Code-to-Cloud is a portal-based experience that takes an app-first approach to building, deploying, and running your apps. Code-to-Cloud makes it easier for developers to get started using Azure, without needing to be an expert on the hundreds of different cloud services. 
 
Detect the right Azure services from your repository
 

 
Code-to-Cloud lets you connect your GitHub repositories to Azure, and through analysis of the code inside your GitHub repository, suggests the correct Azure services you should use. Once you deploy, GitHub Actions is used to create a continuous deployment pipeline between your repositories and your newly provisioned cloud services. Once you've deployed your app via Code-to-Cloud, changes to your code will immediately be pushed to your connected Azure services. 
 
Bring your own repository or start from a template
 

 
Code-to-Cloud also provides sample templates, powered by Azure Developer CLI, that provide a helpful blueprint for getting started with Azure. You can use these templates to immediately create a GitHub repository, connect it to Azure, and provision a distinct set of services for the template scenario. Our templates include sample static websites, web apps, and APIs, in a variety of different languages.
 
Manage your app in a consolidated view
 

 
 
In addition to making it easier and faster to get started developing, Code-to-Cloud also provides a simplified, app-centric management experience. A "Space" is a loose collection of cloud services that, collectively, comprise the app you are building. You can manage your compute, database, caching, and other key services all within the same, easy-to-use management experience.
 
To get started immediately, you can check out Code-to-Cloud here. You can also read our documentation to get a better look at what Code-to-Cloud can do for you.]]></summary>

Cloud-native development is a paradigm that aims to deliver scalable, resilient, and adaptable applications that can run on any cloud platform. Microsoft's cloud-native products, such as Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Functions, and Azure DevOps, provide the tools and services to help developers build, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications with ease. We have seen this transformation take form in the way Zooniverse adopted Azure in order to become more efficient when updating their people-powered research platform and using the grant funding they run on. PosAm is able to help users find parking spaces faster, while also decreasing carbon emissions of vehicles as a result.

Now there's another option through add-ons. Add-ons are Microsoft curated containers that are intended for development use where the full enterprise-grade quality of Azure managed services is not needed.

That’s why we so often spend so much effort to optimize the time between “File Save” and “Browser Reload”. A lot of time this loop happens entirely on our workstations, and we forgo the true end-to-end test of reviewing our changes on the platform that will later run the application -- doing so usually takes too long.
 
This gap between developing and running an application is often also the reason we rarely keep our applications up to date. Once an app is running and we’ve moved on to the next project, it’s often too tedious to come back. We need to switch context, reopen an old project we barely remember, just to check if there’s been an update to any of the components we’ve used. If t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are proud to announce that the migration to Git packaging succeeded! 🥳
Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!
Package sources are now available on GitLab. Note that the bugtracker is still flyspray and that merge requests are not accepted as of now. 
We intend to open the issue tracker and merge requests on the Gitlab package repos in the near future.
Mirrors are syncing again, but it may take a bit of time until your mirror of choice has caught up.
For users
Update your system and merge the pacman pacnew /etc/pacman.conf.pacnew file. This is required as we have moved the [community] repository into [extra].
$ pacman -Syu "pacman>=6.0.2-7"

For users of the now deprecated asp tool, you will need to switch to pkgctl:
$ pacman -Syu "devtools>=1:1.0.0-1"
$ pkgctl repo clone linux

For some more detailed instructions on how to obtain PKGBUILDs see the corresponding wiki article.
For packagers
Before starting, first uninstall devtools-git-poc and remove any repos from your filesystem that you cloned during the git proof-of-concept testing.
Make sure you have both, an updated devtools and pacman on your system:
$ pacman -Syu "devtools>=1:1.0.0-1" "pacman>=6.0.2-7"

Additionally clean up old chroots in /var/lib/archbuild/
$ rm -rf /var/lib/archbuild/
# or optionally, use the --clean option for pkgctl build *ONCE*
$ pkgctl build --clean

For instruction on how to use pkgctl, please take a look at the "How to be a packager" wiki article and also consult the man page of each subcommand for further information:
$ man pkgctl-build
$ man pkgctl-repo-clone]]></summary>

        <link href="https://archlinux.org/news/git-migration-announcement/"/>
        <updated>2023-05-15T19:50:21.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This Friday morning (2023-05-19) the Git packaging migration will start until Sunday (2023-05-21). The Arch Linux packaging team will not be able to update packages in any of the repositories during this period.
Notification when the migration starts, and when it is completed, will be published on the [arch-dev-public] mailing list.
How does this impact Arch Linux users?
The [testing] repository will be split into [core-testing] and [extra-testing], the [staging] repository will be split into [core-staging] and [extra-staging]. The [community] repository will be merged into [extra] and will therefore be empty after the migration.
All affected repositories will be provided as empty repositories for a transition period after the migration. For regular users, this means that everything works as before.
Note: After the migration is done, users that have the testing repositories enabled need to include the new repositories ([core-testing] and [extra-testing] instead of [testing]) in their pacman.conf before updating their system.
Other changes:
SVN access is discontinued and will dissappear.
The svn2git mirror will no longer be updated.
asp, which relies on the svn2git mirror, will stop working. It is replaced by pkgctl repo clone.
How does this impact Arch Linux tier 1 mirrors?
During the migration rsync and HTTP access will be shut down. We will send an email notification to arch-mirrors once everything has been finished.
How does this impact Arch Linux packagers?
Packagers will not be able to patch and update their packages. The internal Tier 0 mirror is also going to be disabled for the duration of this migration.]]></summary>
