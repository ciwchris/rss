Firstly, all the changes can be found in this breaking change doc, also we have a Github post to track the changes. I’m not going to go into details about each difference mentioned in the post, but I will highlight some breaking changes below.
 
So, what’s changed?
Azure Function Proxies → Azure API Management
The use of Azure Function Proxies has been decommissioned in V4, and it will be replaced by APIM(Azure API Management) instead. APIM will come as a separate service with more functionalities and built-in security sets, version controls, and more. For details…]]></summary>

A new study with more than 200 participants now provides insights into the interaction of these pathological phenomena. The data suggest that tau load in the brain impairs memory functions only when amyloid burden is also high. These findings therefore support therapeutic approaches aimed at removing amyloid from the brain in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.]]></summary>

The idea has been rephrased a million times in different medias, but I like DFW’s framing of “whatever you worship will eat you alive”. A decade ago, I honestly believed I’d learn a few things, achieve what I wanted, and settle into a sort of non-striving creative flow for the rest of my days. I was – and am – avoiding flashy purchases or other obvious signs that I’m hopping on the Hedonic treadmill. But it didn’t work. The treadmill isn’t necessarily about money or fame.

The SCM site is the engine behind App Service for deployment, meaning that the release pipeline of Azure DevOps deploys code to the SCM site of an app. In most scenario, SCM site can be reached through public internet. Therefore, ensuring secure access to the site becomes more important. We can enable access restriction on SCM site or set up other firewall solutions to control incoming traffic to the site.

Here we will introduce you on how to identify and whitelist deployment traffic from Azure pipeline to SCM site with access restriction. This article also applies when setting up the same rules in other firewall solutions.

"What if we can provision Azure Static Web App and deploy the app at the same time? If we can, we just simply hand over our PoC repository to developers so that they just run it directly from there."

 
Although two challenges exist to achieve this idea, if we can combine both challenges, devs can autopilot everything from the resource creating to the app deployment, which will result in improving the development experiences. Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to offer the autopilot feature for your application repository.
 

You can download the sample code from this repository.

and am using to show some numbers and charts in my apartment
as ambient data. I think it’s pretty cool.

Alternative display hardware
I really like alternative display technology.
eInk displays,
unlit LEDs, like on my AlphaSmart,
or flip-disc displays,
vane displays,
split-flap displays - I wish
it was all more widespread. Sure, those flip board displays have
mechanical failures more often than traditional screens, but
they look and sound so nice.
Most alternative display technology is expensive and inconvenient,
especially when compared to the absolute marvel of supply-chain
efficiency that is modern traditional LED displays. You can buy
a decent 39” TV for a little over $200 today. A 31” eInk panel will run you
$1,500, and a fl…]]></summary>
