        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that helps you run performance and load tests on your web applications and APIs. You can easily create, configure, and execute load tests using JMeter scripts or custom code, and monitor the results in real-time on the Azure portal. You can also integrate your load tests with your CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub actions.
Until now, you could only view the load test results on the Azure portal, which required internet access and RBAC permissions. Now, you can download the report as an HTML file and share it with your stakeholders or teammates offline. The HTML report contains the same charts and metrics as the online report, but in a portable and convenient format.
Why should you download an offline test report?

In the team’s ongoing commitment to improving Azure Container Apps’ performance, we’ve recently made significant improvements to make the scaling and load balancing behavior of Azure Container Apps more intuitive and better align with customer expectations to meet their performance needs.
 
Hopefully, some of the insights from our experience in working with Envoy and KEDA will be helpful to you.
 
Load Balancing Algorithm Update
In the past, Azure Container Apps relied on the ring hash load balancing algorithm to distribute incoming requests across containers. Ring hash aims for minimal distribution by generating a hash based on request properties to match it with a stable upst…]]></summary>

Over the last year, we have seen a large interest from customers to bring intelligence to their existing and new applications based on the innovation that has recently occurred in artificial intelligence and particularly Azure OpenAI.
 
After working with customers, a few common challenges have shown up when building these intelligent applications.

Developers often feel that they need to become AI engineers to integrate the capabilities into their application.
Most of the samples are in languages like Python and this is often not the expertise of the existing developers or what the organizations' applications are built with.

Azure Chaos Studio is a managed service that uses chaos engineering to help you measure, understand, and improve your cloud application and service resilience. Chaos engineering is a methodology by which you inject real-world faults into your application to run controlled fault injection experiments.
Azure Chaos Studio has added a new fault action for Azure Event Hubs called Change Event Hub State.
This fault action lets users disable entities within a targeted Azure Event Hubs namespace either partially or fully to test messaging infrastructure for maintenance or failure scenarios for an application dependent on an Event Hub.
The fault can be used in the Azure portal by designing experiments, deploying templates, or using the RES…]]></summary>
