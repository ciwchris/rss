        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL; DR
Socket.IO library is natively supported on Azure. Since we public previewed this feature, we received positive feedback from users. Now we are happy to share that Web PubSub for Socket.IO is generally available, which means that Azure customers can expect stable APIs, SLAs customer support and it’s suitable for use in production.
 
Solve the scalability issue without code rewrite.
When we interviewed Socket.IO users, the challenge of scaling out Socket.IO servers came up repeatedly. It’s a challenge that can be met uniquely by Azure. With the input from Socket.IO users, it’s a challenge we aimed to solve when we public previewed the support for Socket.IO on Azure two months ago. 
 
Developers can continue using the Socket.IO APIs they know and love and migrate to Azure seamless with…]]></summary>

Function invocations' time duration might span with a wide range (such as function which handles uploaded files whose size might be a few KB or more than tens GB), notification is needed if a function invocation persists for a long time or it fails with timeout.

Containers are popular for cloud native application development and have increasingly become the common target for software supply chain attacks. Thus, delivering tools to help secure containerized software supply chains has been a growing call of AKS customers.
 
Digital signatures provide a way for software consumers to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the containers deployed. Image signing has become one of the most popular solutions to the aforementioned concern. The signed container images enable users to ensure deployments are built from a trusted entity and verify that those images haven't been tampered with since their creation.

This not only increases the development workload but also gives rise to maintenance and security challenges. However, the introduction of a gateway concept provides an innovative solution to these issues.
VMware Spring Cloud Gateway, acting as the first line of defense for all incoming requests, assumes the crucial responsibility of handling identity authentication, verifying user identities, and validating their permissions. This means that each microservice no longer needs to code authentication and authorization independently, thus reducing the development workload significantly.

The company and product side of Placemark didn’t work out.
Some fantastic, friendly people used it, but I couldn’t find a way to make it work
as a sustainable bootstrapped startup. Building it was incredibly fun.
Failing to find success and sustainability was pretty hard but it’s okay.
Here’s the plan:
Today I’m turning off signups to Placemark.io.
Placemark is free for all existing customers until January 19, 2023,
at which point the servers will be shut down.
Later in January, I’ll release the full source code to the site. This might
take a little while. It’s a big application.
Building Placemark was an incredible experience. I learned a ton and got to
know a lot of new people in the process. I’m really proud of what it turned
out to be, even if the business fell short of my goals.
I built, coded, designed, documented, marketed, and ran Placemark. It had paying
customers who used it for real-world purposes. It shipped, and it was a real business.
With luck, it’ll become something as an open source project – either maintained,
or used as inspiration and fuel for future projects. I’m happy to create more
value than I capture.
There’s more to write about what I learned, but for now I just want to say
thanks to everyone who gave it a shot, and all of the people who were
supportive along the way - special thanks to
Gabriel Coch, Aaron Boodman,
Brian Lovin, Adam Krebs,
Prerna Nadathur, and many others.]]></summary>

My Olympus XA-2 is
my default walking-around camera. I love it, but its age is showing
and I’m envious of the crisp photos that people get out of later-era
SLR film cameras. Thinking about getting a lightweight viewfinder
for my monstrous Nikon F, or buying something like a Nikon FM2.
There’s a paradox to this gear, though, and I don’t want to delude
myself into thinking that I’d use a slightly different camera more
when really the issue is that I’m not shooting many photos regardless.

These were shot with SantaColor,
which produces the strong green & red channels. It’s interesting?
I chose not to “correct it” all the way back to natural lighting.
Or I couldn’t find a way to do that without ruining the look.

Getting film developed is harder than ever, but most major cities
have an option.
In New York, I use Gelatin and
Pink Folder Film House
In DC, I used Dodge Chrome
In San Francisco, I used Photoworks

I’m still using Capture One to manage my photos, which is expensive and vastly overkill but

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Virtual network integration in App Service requires one subnet per App Service plan integration today. If you are working with many App Service plans, managing the subnets can be an unnecessary administrative task. Therefore, I am happy to announce that we are introducing Multi-plan subnet join (MPSJ) in limited public preview at Ignite 2023.
 
MPSJ reduces subnet sprawl when dealing with many apps across many plans and simplifies management of networking control such as Network Security Groups and Route tables across App Service plans. With MPSJ you can join a virtual network/subnet in a different subscription, but all App Service plan joining a specific subnet must be in the same subscription.
 
You may still want to use individual subnets if you plan to differentiate on Network Security…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are introducing a change in JDK/JRE packages of our distro. This is
triggered from the way a JRE is build in modern versions of Java (>9). We are
introducing this change in Java 21.
To sum it up instead of having JDK and JRE packages coexist in the same system
we will be making them conflict. The JDK variant package includes the runtime
environment to execute Java applications so if one needs compilation and
runtime of Java they need only the JDK package in the future. If, on the other
hand, they need just runtime of Java then JRE (or jre-headless) will work.
This will (potentially) require a manual user action during upgrade:
If you have both JDK and JRE installed you can manually install the JDK
with pacman -Syu jdk-openjdk and this removes the JRE related packages.
If you have both JRE and JRE-headless you will need to choose one of
them and install it manually since they would conflict each other now.
If you only have one of the JDK/JRE/JRE-headless pacman should resolve
dependencies normally and no action is needed.
At the moment this is only valid for the upcoming JDK 21 release.]]></summary>

The network plugin determines how the pods and nodes communicate with each other and with external resources. 
Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on your requirements and preferences.
 
In this blog post, I will explain the differences between Kubenet and Azure CNI, and help you choose the best option for your AKS cluster.
 
Here is a short overview of the network plugin types available to Azure Kubernetes Service:

Really took advantage of the breadth of New York culture: I saw an opera at the Metropolitan Opera House, and then went to see prog-metal band Polyphia play guitar solos as fast as possible. At the latter, there were multiple mosh pits and the most packed audience I’ve ever encountered. It was my first ‘metal’ oriented concert, and the friendliness and openness of everyone who attended was remarkable.


Via Arts Gowanus, I saw lots of local art and was especially struck by Perrin Ireland’s art about animals, gender, and climate change.

It has been a slow, silly process in which I celebrate when a single

I’m just writing a Rust program that renders some WebP graphics and
pushes them to Tidbyt’s API.

I’ve had a lot of type 2 fun. I’ve also learned a lot more about Rust.
It’s probably not useful for many people, but
the repository is now open source.
There’s a little implementation of checking a Fastmail email

Plus, there’s an implementation of checking
