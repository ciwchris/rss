When it comes to website security, one important step is to add a custom domain and connect it with a TLS/SSL certificate. This not only enhances the trust and safety of your website but also ensures that your visitors' information is encrypted and protected. Azure App Service provides TLS bindings for the most common custom domains. This blog discusses the special domain and certificate binding situations in Azure App Service for IDN hostnames.

What is an IDN hostname?
An IDN hostname is a domain name that includes characters used in the local representation of languages not written with the basic Latin alphabet "a-z". These characters can be Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Cyrillic, Tamil, Hindi, and more.

All Azure Spring Apps regions under the Enterprise plan are eligible for substantial cost savings – 20% for one year and 47% for three years – when you commit to Azure savings Plan.
 
Committing to the savings plan allows you to get savings, up to the hourly commitment amount, on the resources you use. You can choose to pay all at once or monthly. The best part? Turning on the Savings Plan will not mess with your current set-ups or apps. You just get the savings while everything runs as usual. If you are running big apps, this plan can optimize your investments. It brings down your overall costs for using Azure Spring Apps Enterprise.

By the numbers, 2023 was pretty normal: I read around 20 books, ran around 400 miles. It’s funny how the statistics even out to the same numbers when, during the year, I think I’m in a reading drought or, like several months this year, hadn’t run in weeks.
What was the best?

I think that the best book in general that I read was Achieving Our Country by Richard Rorty. I think I’ve been politically shifting for a while now – not to the left or the right, but around questions of reform versus radicalism, unification versus schism. Rorty isn’t the last word on the matter, but reading him was inspiring because it opened my eyes to the other possibilities of how t…]]></summary>

and they can’t, or they’ve bought a house. The desire to own ones own home is
almost universal in the people I know in the US. It’s even stronger for folks
who live outside of major cities. And people for whom the “security” part of
homeownership rings stronger - who grew up in instability or in countries where
physical goods are preferred to financial instruments for savings.
I don’t want to buy a house. Maybe I’ll need to, but I can’t help but think that
the milestone is vastly overrated in public imagination and there are problems
with it on a personal and societal level.

Build and deploy a Spring REST app to Azure Container Apps directly from the source. 
Package the front-end Angular app in a container first and deploy it to Azure Container Apps.
