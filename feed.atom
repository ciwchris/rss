        <updated>2023-07-19T03:22:36.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a PHP developer, sometimes you might want to set the custom configuration file (.ini) to read when PHP starts up. For this article, I would like demonstrate how to load custom configuration file (.ini) in the Azure App Service.
 
By default, we set the PHP_INI_DIR = /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, so when using SSH on Kudu, you could see there are lots of .ini files:

 
Based on this, you might think we could just manually add our custom .ini files in /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, but it will not work after restart. Since only "/home" data will be persistent after restarting App Service. So what we need to do is to add our .ini in "/home", E.g. "/home/site/ini"
 
For example, if I would like to modify "upload_max_filesize to 64M (defualt is 2M) and post_max_size to 64M (default is 8M)" for the PHP website, I could follow the below steps to achieve it:
 
Step 1:
Use like vi/vim command to add setting.ini file in the "/home/site/ini" folder

 
Step 2:
PHP supports scanning multiple directories for .ini files. For this we need to set PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with ":" to separate values on the Application Setting for the target App Service.
E.g. PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR = :/home/site/ini
This ensures that we load *.ini files from  /usr/local/etc/php and then load from /home/site/ini

 
 
After, we check the value by simple php page and it will show upload_max_size and post_max_size are set as 64M now.

  The SSV2 feature starts or stops Azure Virtual Machines instances across multiple subscriptions. It starts or stops virtual machines on user-defined   schedules, provides insights through Azure Application Insights, and sends optional notifications by using action groups.
  Azure offers an ARM template for deployment. So, you can easily deploy SSV2 using GitHub.
  For more detail, please see the SSV2 docs.
 
Purpose of SSV2
 The main purpose of using SSV2 is to save costs. By using Scheduled SSV2, we can turn on the VM only during business hours (ex. 9AM-6PM) and shut it down the rest of the time. Also, we can set the VM to automatically shut down when not in use by the Auto Stop function.In this post, I focus on how much we can save VM resource costs using SSV2.

To limit the traffic within the container app environment, an Nginx container was utilized as a reverse proxy server and public endpoint to direct all inbound traffics to the appropriate container app based on the URL. The traffic flow for this architecture is as follows:

To demonstrate how to achieve this, I created a simple proof-of-concept (POC) and would like to share the configuration details in case anyone is interested in creating a similar system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.
 
Here are the steps to create a preview environment:
 
1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it "dev".


 
2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include "dev" in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.

 
3. Set "production_branch" to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.

 
4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named 'dev' for the dev branch.

 
5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the "deployment_environment" to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.

 

 
The main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named. 
 
Overall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment. The choice of environment type typically depends on the specific needs and development process of your project.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encrypting data at rest is a primary step in securing a Kubernetes cluster. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.
For clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview:
We can secure a custom DNS name with the help of TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service.
 
When hosting a website on Azure App Service, it is important to ensure that the site is secure and can be accessed via a custom domain name. This can be achieved by using TLS/SSL binding, which encrypts data transmitted to and from the website, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is protected. With this setup, users can access the website via a custom domain name, which adds an extra layer of professionalism and branding to the site.
 
Issue:
The users are not able to purchase and bind the app service certificate for their app service having a custom domain with a special character from Azure Portal.
 
Solution and recommendations:

Azure by default does not provide the facility to purchase the custom domain with the special character except periods and dashes.

 


The user can purchase the custom domain outside Azure with special characters apart from periods and dashes.
In this case, the user will not be able to purchase the App Service Certificate from Azure with the custom domain consists a special character.
To purchase and bind the Certificate with such domain from Azure Portal, the custom domain first needs to be converted to its Punny code using the below converter:

 
Punycode converter (IDN converter), Punycode to Unicode :wrench:(punycoder.com)

 

Purchase the certificate with the Punny code custom domain and bind the certificate with the app service custom domain.

Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
 

Browse the app service to verify the SSL Certificate.


 
If this helps you, do let me know via like and comments section, cheers!
Happy Learning!

the birthplace of Mapbox.
This one will be quick because I’m between one thing
and another!
Listening
Dry Daniel by Buke and Gase

Buke and Gase released some music they recorded a while ago,
and there are some hits in it. I especially love this
track ‘Bubbles,’ which really could be a radio hit.
I’ve also been listening to Spellcaster: The Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried,
which will probably be only one of 20 podcasts, TV shows,
movies, books about SBF. But it’s pretty good.
Bloomberg puts out good content!
Reading
I read Capital Without Borders,
which is a great add-on if you’ve already read Piketty’s Capital
or anything by Zucman, Saez, etc. It really gives you a level-headed
perspective of what exactly the wealth management industry does,
and how it affects the word.
Right now, I’m reading Crabgrass Kingdom,
which I found via the New York Times piece on Vienna.
It’s pretty good, but unfortunately kind of dated - when it was
published in the 80s, US cities hadn’t started their arc back
toward growth and power. Still pretty good, though!
The Vienna piece is also highly recommended. Very few commentators
have said so clearly that we can’t fix America’s housing problems
without letting go of our obsession with owning houses as investments.
The Henry George Program
did, but of course they would.
Watching
I watched some trash this month - The Terminator,
They Live, and Next.
Unfortunately, I think I ran out of the good Nic Cage movies
four movies ago and it’s a slog to watch all the rest.
Only 22% done with watching the whole Cage filmography.]]></summary>
