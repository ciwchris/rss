Pod Sandboxing compliments other security measures and data protection controls and provides the isolation needed within a single VM node, as well as to protect containers that process sensitive information on AKS. This added functionality also avoids the “operations tax” associated with running standard VM nodes per workload. Pod sandboxing on AKS seamlessly integrates with the existing AKS feature set, making it easy to transition the deployment with simple pod annotation changes to existing workloads while continuing to use existing deployment and monitoring practices.

So you need to build an application with minimal operating costs that can also scale to meet the growing demand of your business. This is a perfect scenario for a serverless function, like those built with Azure Functions. With serverless functions you can focus more on the application and less on the infrastructure and operations side of things. However, what happens when you need to include a database in the mix?
 
In this tutorial we'll explore how to create a serverless function with Azure Functions and the .NET runtime to interact with MongoDB Atlas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure and Red Hat have had a long-standing partnership to provide customers with best-in-class cloud solutions, such as jointly-supported Azure Red Hat OpenShift, JBoss EAP on Azure App Service, and deployment templates for JBoss EAP on Azure RHEL VM’s. Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.
 

 
The collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:

Configuring data sources
Java Key Store usage for certificates
Using Maven to deploy to App Service
Proper use of the file system in Azure
Using Azure Service Bus for JMS
Using Azure Active Directory as an identity provider
… and more!

 
Check out this Video Demo for more information.
 
You can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat’s website or install it as a VS Code plugin.

SaaS infrastructures offer better cost efficiencies by leveraging economies of scale, resource pooling and sharing, and increased utilisation of the infrastructure in general.

WP Admin: Also called the backend, admin panel, or admin dashboard, this is the admin area where you can manage your website. You can edit posts and pages, install themes and plugins, add or remove users, and change website settings.
Frontend: This is the section which is accessible to your users. This is where your users can read blog posts, make purchases, or participate in a forum, depending on the kind of website you build using WordPress.

A relatively common problem is that the WP Admin has low performance even when the frontend works fast for your users. Most performance enhancements that you do makes only your frontend faster. This makes it difficult …]]></summary>

When we create App Service Certificate (Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn) in Azure Portal, sometime we are not using it in the App Service but use it for Azure VM or on-prem VM. Moreover, we will use it in some Azure resources (such as upload the certificate to Azure Application Gateway).
 
However, after you export the App Service Certificate from Azure Portal, when you are going to upload it to Azure Application Gateway or use it in the Azure VM or on-prem VM, you would find out sometimes it would need the "password". But you don't know what the password is for the …]]></summary>

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the managed Kubernetes offering from Azure, allows customers to offload the operational overhead to Azure, thus letting the user focus primarily on their workloads and business logic. We are seeing two sets of user trends along the Kubernetes adoption curve. First, organizations that are already using containers and/or Kubernetes in their on-premises and cloud environments are looking to AKS to reduce their operational burden and leverage the Azure cloud ecosystem.

Reading
I only finished one book this month - Meet Us By The Roaring Sea,
which was part of my book club. It was great, and gets me off
on a good footing for reading a lot more fiction in 2023.
I really liked Brian Potter’s weekend roundup,
which covers a lot of funky building technology –
wooden potash storage, robotically-assembled buildings, 3D
printed houses.
I have mixed feelings about the layoffs explainer from prof

And I haven’t really given an update on Placemark, the product and business, in a while. Writing about an operating business is a different thing that writing feature announcements or essays about technology: the ramifications of honesty, spin, or disclosure are so much more vast and unpredictable. This is why we often learn about people’s trials or a company’s struggles only years later, but at the time everyone exudes confidence.
But, having drafted something about this a few times and edited myself into knots, I figure it’s better to just write something. The best writing always comes after I’ve scrapped a draft anyway.

Val.town is a system for programming in the small, for writing short programs in TypeScript that can link together into something larger. It’s for writing that scheduled web scraper or basic API that you wanted to make but didn’t want to add to your pile of servers on AWS or GCP. It’s already a lot of fun to use, and is going to keep getting better.

Placemark lives. It’s still getting better every week. It’s been about two years since I formally started it, and it’s grown into a great product with the help of supportive and creative customers. I’ve been relatively quiet about Placemark-the-business, despite writing a steady flow of blog posts on features & improvements on placemark.io. But, soon - I’ll publish a state of Placemark in the near future.
I’m tremendously excited about Val.town. It’s a small team in Brooklyn and Seattle, with lots of creative energy. I think we’ll be able to take this opportunity and make something great, something that in retrospect always should have existed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Container Apps (ACA) are built on a solid open source foundation. Behind the scenes, it runs on a managed Kubernetes cluster and includes several open source components, including Dapr for microservices creation and execution, Envoy Proxy for ingress functions, and KEDA for event-driven autoscaling. Again, you do not have to install these components yourself. All you need to do is enable and/or configure your container app to use these components.
 
In this blog, we will see how can we scale Container Apps based on Redis Streams with the Azure managed instance of Redis, i.e. Azure Cache for Redis. We will be referring to the KEDA trigger specification for Redis Streams (Scale applications based on Redis Streams) to configure our Container App. This specification describes the Redis-s…]]></summary>
