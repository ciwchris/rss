By default, HTTP apps in Azure Container Apps are accessible via a public URL that is unique to the app. However, you can create a container app to use a reverse proxy like NGINX to control how traffic is routed to multiple apps based on the path or hostname.
 
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Azure Container Apps to configure path and hostname-based routing for a set of containerized applications using NGINX as a reverse proxy. You'll deploy 4 applications: 1 NGINX container which will be publicly exposed and 3 container apps which will only be accessible from within the environment and that traffic will…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say you work for a company that has a lot of APIs. You might have a few questions:
 

How do you manage the lifecycle of those APIs?
What governance would you apply to these APIs?
What is the list of environments needed to manage these APIs?
What are the deployment strategies for those APIs?
How would you integrate those APIs with other services?

 
As your company's number of APIs increases, so does the complexity of managing them. Azure API Center (APIC) is a central repository for your APIs lifecycle management, and it offers the more efficient ways for management. Throughout this post, I will take a first look at what Azure API Center is and what it offers.
 

You can find a sample code from this GitHub repository.

So Cloud Native is not about technologies, if you can do all of the above, then you are Cloud Native. You don’t have to use Kubernetes for instance, to become Cloud Native.

In the previous post we set up our AKS cluster and configured NGINX. Now we will deploy two sample applications and deploy them. You can follow the official documentation here Create an unmanaged ingress controller.

Our systems can sometimes be a black box. We toss a request into it and get something back, but what goes on inside? Cutting through the tech jargon, observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.
 
You might wonder, isn’t that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there’s a glitch slowing things down (that’s the “What”). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the “Why”).
 
Let’s say an app is responding slowly. We might have all these cool charts and graphs showing us the problem, but do they tell us why it’s happening? Not always.
 
That’s where solid observability comes in…]]></summary>
