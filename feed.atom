        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As developers, we love the benefits of containers, but they're not always easy to deploy. It can be a cumbersome process to build a container image, push it to a registry, and then set up infrastructure and deploy the container.
 
Azure Container Apps is a modern, fully-managed, serverless platform for running containers. While we don't have to manage infrastructure, it's still up to us to figure out how to build our container image and deploy it.
 
Today, we're introducing a preview feature in the Azure CLI that streamlines the process of deploying to Azure Container Apps in a single command. Whether your source code is on your local machine or in GitHub, "az containerapp up" is the only command you need to get your app running in Azure Container Apps.
 
How does it work?

First, what is GitOps? Is it the same as DevOps? I'm so glad you asked. Let's begin with a refresher on what DevOps is:
 
"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users." ~ Donovan Brown
 
Donovan puts it best - DevOps is a combination of several key factors: people, process, and products - but it starts with people. Getting started with DevOps involves a cultural shift, which means it's so much more than buzz words like agile, continuous integration, continuous deployment, automation, etc. While those buzz words have their place and are needed, truly embracing DevOps means creating a DevOps culture between your engineering teams - this includes developers, operations, security, and beyond.

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>

Azure Spring Cloud platform provides AppPlatformIngressLogs to query Ingress request log for those Apps with endpoint enabled.
But for the Apps with endpoint disabled, since the traffic is not going through the platform load balancer, the ingress request log is not recorded. For such cases, to monitor the App access log, we can use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like Application Insights.
 
In this blog, let's demonstrate how to use AppPlatformIngressLogs and Application Insights to monitor both types of request access log.

The identity is managed by the Azure platform and does not require you to provision or rotate any secrets.
We have two types of Managed Identities:

System-assigned Identity
User-assigned Identity

You can read about Managed Identity for App Service and Azure Functions here.
Below are the steps for the configuration:

You can create an App Service or an Azure Function and use the code example below to retrieve the token using the Azure Identity client library via System-assigned identity:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.
 
Before talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss "what is web.xml"?
 
Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.
 
The default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.
 
When tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. 
 
It instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.
There you specify:

what servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to
listeners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)
configuration parameters (context-params)
error pages, welcome files
security constraints

Back to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:

 
To add a custom error page, please follow below steps:

Add <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page "error.html" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use "/error.html" in <location></location>.



Add your custom error in webapps folder.



Build and re-deploy the project to App Service.
Now you will see the custom error page replace the default one.


 
Please kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.]]></summary>

The idea of individuals contributing streetview-like imagery with a dashcam is not new. Mapillary did exactly that starting in 2013, established a large dataset and active community in a few years, and sold to Facebook in 2020.

Solution Architecture
 
Let's say you're building a microservices architecture. It typically consists of an API gateway and many API apps, which are Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Functions API in this example. The microservices architecture might be more complex depending on the requirements, but it's way too far from our topic. Therefore, let's build a minimal structure that is working. Here's the diagram.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers evaluated whether dietary fiber intake was associated with a decrease in inflammation in older adults and if fiber was inversely related to cardiovascular disease. The results showed that total fiber, and more specifically cereal fiber but not fruit or vegetable fiber, was consistently associated with lower inflammation and lower CVD incidence. Until now there had been limited data on the link between fiber and inflammation among older adults, who have higher levels of inflammation compared with younger adults.]]></summary>

The charts are the result of a research project spanning six continents and bringing together possibly the largest ever MRI datasets ever aggregated -- almost 125,000 brain scans from over a 100 different studies. Although not currently intended for clinical use, the team hopes the charts will become a routine clinical tool similar to how standardised paediatric growth charts are used.]]></summary>

Firstly, all the changes can be found in this breaking change doc, also we have a Github post to track the changes. I’m not going to go into details about each difference mentioned in the post, but I will highlight some breaking changes below.
 
So, what’s changed?
Azure Function Proxies → Azure API Management
The use of Azure Function Proxies has been decommissioned in V4, and it will be replaced by APIM(Azure API Management) instead. APIM will come as a separate service with more functionalities and built-in security sets, version controls, and more. For details…]]></summary>

However, about 20% of patients develop incurable metastatic prostate cancer, resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths each year in Austria alone. Medical research has not yet adequately explained why metastases occur in some people and not in others. A research team has now discovered specific changes in a protein that drive the growth and spread of prostate cancer.]]></summary>

The researchers also collected urine samples, most of which contained secondary metabolites of ethanol. The results provide further evidence that our primate ancestors preferentially sought out fermented, alcohol-containing fruit likely for its greater nutritional value, and that humans may have inherited this proclivity for ethanol.]]></summary>
