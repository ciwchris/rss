        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since the last update of v1.4.0, this Azure Functions OpenAPI extension has a lot of improvements. Here in this post, let's discuss what improvements have been made.
Update – v1.5.0
.NET 7 support for the isolated worker extension
According to the Azure Functions roadmap, Azure Functions isolated worker model has started supporting .NET 7. Therefore, this OpenAPI extension also starts supporting .NET 7 with the isolated worker model. The migration step is as easy as changing the target framework. Update your .csproj file and find the <TargetFramework> node, and change it from netcoreapp3.1 (.NET Core 3.1), net5.0 (.NET 5) or net6.0 (.NET 6), to net7.0 (.NET 7).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently there is no standard REST API to monitor swap operation, apart from using the activity logs. 
 
Web Apps - Swap Slot Slot - REST API (Azure App Service) | Microsoft Docs
 
However, we have recently found the following way to monitor the Swap operation and the same API is being used by Azure portal as well to update the Swap status and it's comparatively fast. Please refer to the steps below:
 

First call the POST Slot-Swap API & it will trigger the swap operation as shown below:

https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/slotsswap?api-version=2022-03-01
 
 

 
2. The above API will have location parameter in Response Headers with Operation Results API call which can be used to continuously poll in a loop until the Response is 200 (Swap completed) or (failure status code in case of swap failure)
 
GET: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/operationresults/915677b6-ea92-44c9-865b-95cfc693d5bb?api-version=2018-11-01
 
Polling: Swap in accepted/in-progress state:
 

 
Polling: Swap completed:

The endpoints may be sitting behind a firewall, or they may be only accessible from within a virtual network, or they may not have been made public yet as they are under development. Microsoft Azure Load Testing supports private endpoint load testing using VNet injection. This injects the load generating virtual machines into the same virtual network as your private endpoint.
Azure Load Testing support for private endpoint load testing is currently available in seven regions with expansion on the horizon.

What you might not have heard is that low-code development isn’t just for citizen developers, it’s for code-first developers too.  
Low code apps aren’t designed to replace or automate your job. Rather, they empower you to accelerate application development by collaborating with citizen developers while maintaining governance of your apps at scale.

I think it took over a month to get through it - kept losing momentum by

it was good, it won a Pulitzer. I enjoyed it, but I wish I enjoyed reading it more,
and I’m not sure why.
There have been hundreds of articles written about Twitter and FTX this month.
I read a lot of both, and none of the FTX articles particularly stuck out,
but jwz’s writing has been a fun way to follow
along with some of the Mastodon/Twitter hype. That’s jwz of Mozilla, Netscape Navigator, and DNA Lounge.
Nick Maggiulli’s How Much Growth Can You Expect?
was an interesting read, but even moreso I appreciate that all of his
analysis is open source on GitHub
and serves as a neat example learning a bit of R.
Listening

Not a big month for new music, the only thing that really hooked me in November was
Pavane pour une infante défunte by Maurice Ravel.
I’m trying to learn it on guitar (like most classical, there’s a great tab
on classtab), but the original version on piano is so lovely.
Watching

Serial Mom was, I think, the first John
Waters film I’ve watched. Made me want to watch more from the back catalog.

I’m continuing the mission of watching all the Nic Cage films - at
18% so far - with Matchstick Men.
It’s one of the good ones.
Finished Only Murders in The Building,
which has a sort of extreme mass-appeal quality that’s become more boring than
appealing lately.]]></summary>

The work focuses on a 22-base fragment of transfer RNA, tRF-3b, which is modified by the enzyme complex TRMT6/61A. In bladder cancer, the levels of TRMT6/61A -- a methyltransferase -- are elevated. The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.]]></summary>

Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they'd been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.]]></summary>

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.]]></summary>

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.]]></summary>
