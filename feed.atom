        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.
 
Before talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss "what is web.xml"?
 
Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.
 
The default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.
 
When tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. 
 
It instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.
There you specify:

what servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to
listeners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)
configuration parameters (context-params)
error pages, welcome files
security constraints

Back to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:

 
To add a custom error page, please follow below steps:

Add <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page "error.html" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use "/error.html" in <location></location>.



Add your custom error in webapps folder.



Build and re-deploy the project to App Service.
Now you will see the custom error page replace the default one.


 
Please kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hivemapper is a company that recently pivoted from drone mapping to dashcam mapping, and has added a crypto element as a way of compensating people who contribute imagery. They teased a dashcam hardware in 2020, and announced the crypto angle in 2022.
The idea of individuals contributing streetview-like imagery with a dashcam is not new. Mapillary did exactly that starting in 2013, established a large dataset and active community in a few years, and sold to Facebook in 2020.
What follows is a quick review of what is currently available about Hivemapper’s new phase:
What is a “map” in this case?
A map is streetview-like imagery. The type and breadth of data collected is really similar to what Mapillary collected: you’re getting front-facing camera imagery with GPS. Sure, you can collect a f…]]></summary>

For inbound access, you need private endpoints, which allow clients located in your private network to securely access your apps over Private Link, which eliminates exposure from the public internet.

With this update, you can use our lower-cost tiers and achieve the same level of security that you could previously only achieve with our high-end SKUs.

Solution Architecture
 
Let's say you're building a microservices architecture. It typically consists of an API gateway and many API apps, which are Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Functions API in this example. The microservices architecture might be more complex depending on the requirements, but it's way too far from our topic. Therefore, let's build a minimal structure that is working. Here's the diagram.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An international team of researchers has created a series of brain charts spanning our entire lifespan -- from a 15 week old fetus to 100 year old adult -- that show how our brains expand rapidly in early life and slowly shrink as we age. The charts are the result of a research project spanning six continents and bringing together possibly the largest ever MRI datasets ever aggregated -- almost 125,000 brain scans from over a 100 different studies. Although not currently intended for clinical use, the team hopes the charts will become a routine clinical tool similar to how standardised paediatric growth charts are used.]]></summary>

Firstly, all the changes can be found in this breaking change doc, also we have a Github post to track the changes. I’m not going to go into details about each difference mentioned in the post, but I will highlight some breaking changes below.
 
So, what’s changed?
Azure Function Proxies → Azure API Management
The use of Azure Function Proxies has been decommissioned in V4, and it will be replaced by APIM(Azure API Management) instead. APIM will come as a separate service with more functionalities and built-in security sets, version controls, and more. For details…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Prostate cancers remain localized in the majority of cases, giving affected individuals a good chance of survival. However, about 20% of patients develop incurable metastatic prostate cancer, resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths each year in Austria alone. Medical research has not yet adequately explained why metastases occur in some people and not in others. A research team has now discovered specific changes in a protein that drive the growth and spread of prostate cancer.]]></summary>
