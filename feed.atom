        <updated>2023-09-01T01:34:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.
 
1. Install the plugin
In IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -> Settings -> Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.

 
2. Leverage the plugin
Open the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.

You will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.

 
3. Resolve conflict
To resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.
After resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.

 
4. Conclusion
Dependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.

Brooklyn Navy Yard. It’s
been fun to identify the ships docked there, but an airplane was new,
especially such a rare one. I guess a lot of airplane knowledge from
my childhood has stayed with me, and being greeted by this Concorde,
and watching the new Top Gun has brought it back.
This one’s G-BOAD,
the Concorde that’s been flown the most, and it usually lives at
the Intrepid, but
it badly needs a new coat of paint, so it’s in the Navy Yard for that.
Pretty fun! They brought it there on a barge.

The only great film I watched this month was Snatch.
Brad Pitt’s accent in the film, which is supposed to be that of an
Irish Traveller, is a big highlight.


On the shorter video front, I’ve been enjoying Berm Peak, whi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our last roadmap update was in September 2022, in which we outlined our plans for bringing the Azure Functions isolated worker model to parity with the in-process model. In that post, we also stated that we would have another update in early 2023, but unfortunately this did not happen. However, we’ve made great progress since the last post, and today we’d like to share where we’re at with the isolated worker model, and how we’re thinking about the future.
 
Isolated worker model assessment
The isolated worker model you author your functions in a way that’s aligned with how the .NET ecosystem has evolved. It offers a rich dependency injection model, full control over main() and app dependencies, improved reliability, additional features like invocation middleware, and more.

The BSL license was created by the people at MariaDB in 2017 to give companies a way to release software as open source but prohibit their competitors from re-hosting that software and competing with them. In HashiCorp’s case, the license also has a stipulation that their code becomes simply liberally open source under the MPL, four years after it’s published under the BSL.
This prompted the usual outcry from the open source community, and some intelligent analysis. For the legal license analysis, you can do no better than reading Kyle E. Mitchell’s article and his summary of the strategy and list of the implementations at duallicensing.com.

Scaling out Socket.IO apps can be frustrating for developers.
Overwhelmingly, users reported their love of the “intuitive APIs” and how easy it is to get productive with the library once they get over the initial learning curve.

By default, PHP version is getting displayed as in the below screenshot-

 
 Updating PHP Settings-

Go to your KUDU site https://<sitename>.scm.azurewebsites.net.
Select Bash or SSH from the top menu.
In Bash/SSH, go to your "/home/site" directory.
Create a directory called "ini" (i.e. mkdir ini)
Change directories to "ini".
We'll need to create an "ini" file to add our settings to.  In this example, I'm using "settings.ini".  There are no file editors such as Vi, Vim, or Nano so we'll simply use echo to add the settings to the file.  I'm changing the expose_php setting to Off.  Below is the command that I used to add the setting and create an "settings.ini" file if one doesn't already exist.

 NOTE:  If you already have an extensions.ini file, you can use the same command which will add the new setting to the file. 
/home/site/ini>echo " expose_php = Off " >> settings.ini
If using SSH, you can use vi to create/edit the settings file using the following commands.

 vi settings.ini
 Press "i" on your keyboard to start editing and add the following.

 expose_php = Off  
3. Press "Esc", then ":wq!" and enter to save.
Add an Application Setting-
We'll now need to go to the Azure Portal and add an Application Setting to scan the "ini" directory
              1) Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and select your App Service Linux PHP application.
              2) Select Application Settings for the app.
              3) Under the Application settings section, press the "+ Add new setting".
              4) For the App Setting Name, enter "PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR". For the value, enter "/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini"
 
Testing – 
Go to kudu site and run the command below and you can verify that PHP header is removed.
CURL -I <site url pointing to a PHP script>]]></summary>

Pull the required file contents from Azure Storage Account, and store them inside Azure Function App.
Upload files to another VM via SFTP.
