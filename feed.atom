        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[People who are physically active during childhood have higher cognitive functions in later life. Participants who exercised when they were children did better on cognitive tests regardless of their current age. However, no such relationship was found between task performance and post-childhood exercise -- suggesting that exercise during childhood is particularly important for brain development and long-term cognitive health.]]></summary>

Slightly sour foods or drinks such as yogurt and lemon juice are yummy to many, but such highly sour foods as spoiled milk are yucky, even dangerous.

The gut and the brain communicate with each other in order to adapt satiety and blood sugar levels during food consumption. The vagus nerve is an important communicator between these two organs. Researchers now took a closer look at the functions of the different nerve cells in the control center of the vagus nerve, and discovered something very surprising: although the nerve cells are located in the same control center, they innervate different regions of the gut and also differentially control satiety and blood sugar levels. This discovery could play an important role in the development of future therapeutic strategies against obesity and diabetes.]]></summary>

waiting for furniture to arrive, and dreading the next interaction with our
absolutely-terrible-no-good moving company. When VCs and some tech company
‘disrupt’ moving by undercutting and technologizing movers, I will make
an exception and cheer them on: this industry deserves to end.
But then, seeing so many old faces, reconnecting, finding a new
favorite restaurant and bar every few days. Visiting family. Feeling some optimism
about the general future.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As some of you may have read over the past days, there has been an ownership dispute over the freenode.net network. The IRC network has been used by Arch Linux and many other projects over the past decades as a platform for discussion and support.
The dispute led to the exodus of most former freenode staff from the network and the founding of a new network: libera.chat
Starting today, Arch Linux and its sister projects Arch Linux ARM and Arch Linux 32 will begin migrating the official IRC channels from freenode.net to libera.chat. Please bear with us as this can take some time to be fully settled in.
We thank the freenode community for the many years of great service and collaboration.]]></summary>
