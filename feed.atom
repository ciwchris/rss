Genetic evidence in this same population suggested that all levels of alcohol intake are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Notably, the risk of cardiovascular disease linked to light alcohol consumption was modest but rose exponentially with higher intake, even at intake levels currently endorsed as 'low risk.']]></summary>

The configuration needs to be adjusted from the old .xml format to the new /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf.
Prior to the upgrade, stop the keycloak service, upgrade the package and migrate the configuration before starting:
systemctl stop keycloak.service
pacman -Syu keycloak
# migrate configuration /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf
systemctl start keycloak.service

The SCM site is the engine behind App Service for deployment, meaning that the release pipeline of Azure DevOps deploys code to the SCM site of an app. In most scenario, SCM site can be reached through public internet. Therefore, ensuring secure access to the site becomes more important. We can enable access restriction on SCM site or set up other firewall solutions to control incoming traffic to the site.

Here we will introduce you on how to identify and whitelist deployment traffic from Azure pipeline to SCM site with access restriction. This article also applies when setting up the same rules in other firewall solutions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Red Hat JBoss EAP on Azure App Service has been generally available since June 2021 and is jointly supported by Red Hat and Microsoft. Today, we are announcing the Public Preview of support for clustered deployments of JBoss EAP on App Service. This means customers can run Java EE, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications which use stateful session beans, distributed transactions, and similar features that require instance-to-instance communication or high availability. Previously, individual JBoss EAP instances on App Service could not communicate with one another; with this update all nodes can communicate over a virtual network. Read on to learn more!
 
Create a JBoss EAP cluster on App Service now and deploy a stateful application!

"What if we can provision Azure Static Web App and deploy the app at the same time? If we can, we just simply hand over our PoC repository to developers so that they just run it directly from there."

 
Although two challenges exist to achieve this idea, if we can combine both challenges, devs can autopilot everything from the resource creating to the app deployment, which will result in improving the development experiences. Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to offer the autopilot feature for your application repository.
 

You can download the sample code from this repository.

Alternative display hardware
I really like alternative display technology.
eInk displays,
unlit LEDs, like on my AlphaSmart,
or flip-disc displays,
vane displays,
split-flap displays - I wish
it was all more widespread. Sure, those flip board displays have
mechanical failures more often than traditional screens, but
they look and sound so nice.
Most alternative display technology is expensive and inconvenient,
especially when compared to the absolute marvel of supply-chain
efficiency that is modern traditional LED displays. You can buy
a decent 39” TV for a little over $200 today. A 31” eInk panel will run you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Computational biologists have created a neural network model capable of predicting how changes to non-coding DNA sequences in yeast affect gene expression. They also devised a unique way of representing this data in two dimensions, making it easy to understand the past and future evolution of non-coding sequences in organisms beyond yeast -- and even design custom gene expression patterns for gene therapies and industrial applications. Despite the sheer number of genes that each human cell contains, these so-called 'coding' DNA sequences comprise just 1% of our entire genome. The remaining 99% is made up of 'non-coding' DNA -- which, unlike coding DNA, does not carry the instructions to build proteins.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Impressive athleticism was on display during the Winter Olympics, but being at the top of one's game doesn't necessarily protect against digestive distress resulting from exercise. Surprisingly, some people are adding cocoa to their diets to reduce these symptoms. Now, researchers report that long-term daily consumption of cocoa doesn't appear to improve exercise-related digestive issues in male athletes and induces only minimal changes to their gut microbiomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Researchers from two independent research teams have discovered how the mislocalization of a protein, known as TDP-43, alters the genetic instructions for UNC13A, providing a possible therapeutic target that could also have implications in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other forms of dementia. ALS and FTD are two neurodegenerative disorders in which many cases are linked by mislocalization of TDP-43, where instead of being primarily located in the nucleus of the cell where genes are activated, it forms aggregates outside the nucleus in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Rare mutations in the TDP-43 gene are known to cause ALS, but almost all cases of ALS show mislocalization of TDP-43.]]></summary>
