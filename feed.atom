There are many reasons for this symptom, such as connection errors with the storage account, runtime being down, indexing failure, and the synctriggers failure that we'll discuss.
 
To confirm whether your issue is indeed due to synctriggers, you could press F12 in your browser to activate developer mode and search for the keyword "batch" under the "Network" tab. This endpoint is used by the Azure portal to call various internal services of the Function App (e.g., retrieving app settings, site information, getting host status, etc.), including synctriggers.

Until now, you could only view the load test results on the Azure portal, which required internet access and RBAC permissions.

Developers often feel that they need to become AI engineers to integrate the capabilities into their application.
Most of the samples are in languages like Python and this is often not the expertise of the existing developers or what the organizations' applications are built with.

Azure Chaos Studio is a managed service that uses chaos engineering to help you measure, understand, and improve your cloud application and service resilience. Chaos engineering is a methodology by which you inject real-world faults into your application to run controlled fault injection experiments.
Azure Chaos Studio has added a new fault action for Azure Event Hubs called Change Event Hub State.
This fault action lets users disable entities within a targeted Azure Event Hubs namespace either partially or fully to test messaging infrastructure for maintenance or failure scenarios for an application dependent on an Event Hub.

Adding Artificial intelligence (AI) to existing applications is becoming an important part in application development. The correct integration of AI is vital to meet business goals, functional and non-functional requirements and build applications that are efficient to maintain and enhance. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a key part in this integration and an API Manager is fundamental to keep control of the usage, performance, and versioning of APIs – especially in enterprise landscapes.

Why we use it
An increasing number of security vulnerabilities are caused by sensitive information in the source code being leaked or accidentally uploaded to open repositories GitHub, leading to the exposure of a large amount of user privacy. This information includes, but is not limited to, database credentials, app keys, etc. Traditional MySQL databases use usernames and passwords for login operations, naturally leading to the inclusion of these credentials in project configuration files. Even with proper safeguards, there remain unpredictable risks, such as hacking.
 
This tutorial will introduce how to integrate Microsoft Entra with Azure Database for MySQL to avoid using fixed usernames and passwords. By utilizing system-ass…]]></summary>

Note: For the purpose of this article, I'm going to use Entra ID to refer to a user identity, as well as a managed identity such as a service principal, as the approach is the same in this context here.
The above linked documentation covers how you would setup the Azure resource with Entra ID as the authentication mode, so I won't go over that here (also, you can configure that when you initial create the database, or using a Bicep script), instead I want to look at how we use that in a .NET application, because when you're connecting using Entra ID you don't have a pas…]]></summary>

Obsidian Freeform is an extremely
small Obsidian plugin that enables totally custom

Obsidian as my note-taking application, and I found myself wanting to create
charts for certain concepts.
For example, I recently learned about the availability of mortgage discounts
from some banks in exchange for having a high balance. I am
not buying a house, but
nevertheless, these were numbers from multiple sources that could be charted
and compared and nobody was doing it, so I had to. So I made a chart:

We have seen that before load testing these endpoints, most users generate an access token and store it in the Azure Key Vault.

Sometime has elapsed between the act of storing the token in the key vault and the start of execution of the test. There can be a case where the token might expire during the test run and the request at the endpoints start throwing errors. 
Only one static token is stored in the key vault and is used for all the requests. When we are load testing wit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every app will be reinvented with Generative AI and new apps will be built that weren’t possible before. Generative AI helps to build intelligent apps using the Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. As the number of intelligent applications grows alongside the adoption of various large language models (LLMs), enterprises encounter significant challenges in efficiently federating and managing generative AI resources. Key issues include ensuring resiliency and high availability of models, tracking model usage and implementing chargeback mechanisms for users, managing increased latency, and addressing data sovereignty concerns. This demands for a centralized solution “Gen AI Gateway” that must seamlessly integrate, optimize, and distribute the workloads across a federated network of GenAI …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that lets you test the performance and scalability of your web applications and APIs. You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.
Response time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining …]]></summary>
