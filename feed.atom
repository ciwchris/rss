It might also be possible to have heard of or currently use oh-my-posh for your PowerShell. Azure offers Azure Cloud Shell service, which uses both Bash Shell and PowerShell by default. Therefore, if you want either oh-my-zsh or oh-my-posh, or both, you should configure it by yourself.
 
Throughout this post, I'm going to show how to configure your shell environment for both.
 

This GitHub repository provides the working shell script source for your reference.

 
For oh-my-zsh
 
Let's configure oh-my-zsh on your Azure Cloud Shell. Make sure that you see the Bash Shell prompt. If not, enter the bash command to switch your prompt to Bash.

The combination not only decreased arthritis inflammation markers in the cells but improved the production of desired proteins normally found in healthy cartilage.

The markers examined in the study included white matter hyperintensities, which indicate injury to the brain's white matter, and gray matter volume.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, we are excited to announce the general availability of all the features to secure communications end-to-end for Spring Boot apps – in a Zero Trust environment. You can secure communications end-to-end or terminate transport-level security at any communication point for Spring Boot apps. You can also automate the provisioning and configuration for all the Azure resources needed for securing communications.
 
Implementing secure communications as part of your solution architecture can be challenging. Many customers manually rotate their certificates or create their own solutions to automate provisioning and configuration. Even then, there is still data exfiltration risk – say unauthorized copying or transfer of data from server systems. With Azure Spring Cloud, all of this is handled …]]></summary>

Practically every photo I’d license as CC-BY-SA. If someone used one of my photos in their blog, I felt a little jolt of approval and recognition. It felt cool.
The same went for open source. The early communities around Drupal and Node.js were radically open source. Companies were releasing their entire products for free and writing detailed blog posts about how they figured out hard problems. Whatever trade secrets they had wer…]]></summary>

Throughout this post, I'm going to refactor the existing Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD pipeline workflows, using the "reusable workflows" feature of GitHub Actions.

While provisioning an Azure Static Web Apps (ASWA) instance, GitHub Actions workflow is automatically generated by default. Here's a sample workflow. I'm pretty sure it's not that different from yours.

The traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because the market is “efficient” (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.
Coase noted, however, that there are a number of transaction costs to using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is actually more than just the price of the good.

Kubernetes has become a platform of choice for building cloud native applications. Kubernetes is highly scalable, highly available, and easy to use, and has many other advantages that make it an excellent choice for building distributed applications.
 
However, its distributed nature means monitoring everything that is happening within the cluster can be a challenge. Prometheus and Grafana make our experience better.
 
In this article, we will set up a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and deploy Prometheus and Grafana to gather monitoring data and visualize them.
