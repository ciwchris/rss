        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that lets you test the performance and scalability of your web applications and APIs. You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.
Response time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workloads deployed on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster often need to access Azure backing resources, such as Azure Key Vault, databases, or AI services like Azure OpenAI Service. Users are required to manually configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID or Managed Identities so their AKS workloads can securely access these protected resources.
The Service Connector integration greatly simplifies the connection configuration experience for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. Service Connector takes care of authentication and network configurations securely and follows Azure best practices, so you can focus on your application code without worrying about your infrastructure connectivity.

Service Connector Action Breakdown
 
Before, in order to connect from AKS pods to a private Azure backing services using workload identity, users needed to perform the following actions manually:

Create a managed identity
Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL
Create Kubernetes service account
Establish federated identity credential trust
Grant permissions to access Azure Services
Deploy the application

Now, Service Connector performs steps 2 to 5 automatically. Additionally, for Azure services without public access, Service Connector creates private connection components such as private link, private endpoint, DNS record,
You can create a connection in the Service Connection blade within AKS.

 
Click create and select the target service, authentication method, and networking rule. The connection will then be automatically set up. Here are a few helpful links to for you to learn more about Service Connector.

App Spaces is a new way to look at building an application in Azure.  App Spaces is different because it’s not a service on its own, but rather an aggregation of existing Azure services with a simplified interface to make it easier to build and manage your web application.  It’s meant to reduce the confusion about which services to use and how to integrate them together end-to-end via a new visual designer. 
 

 
Building an End-to-End Todo App
Does a simple Todo app need 3-tiers (Front-end, backend, and database) with Google authentication and authorization?  Of course not! But its simplicity is why it’s perfect for explaining the concepts which bring it together.  For this application, I used React as a static front-end framework, Express.js running on Node for my ba…]]></summary>

CI/CD is a system that automates steps in software delivery. For WordPress developers, it means less manual work: once you push updates, the system automatically tests and deploys them. It's like having a assistant that not only speeds up your work but also checks for errors with each update, ensuring your WordPress site runs smoothly. This constant testing and feedback loop means you can fix bugs quickly and improve your site continuously without disrupting the live version. In short, CI/CD makes your development process faster, more efficient, and less error prone.

A staging site, also called as a development site, testing site, or sandbox – is a clone of your actual WordPress website which cannot be accessed by your visitors. This can only be accessed by people who have the staging URL.
 
Why do you need a staging site for your WordPress website?
A staging site is extremely useful when you are working on a WordPress website. It provides a safe area for development, testing, and experimentation. When you are trying out a new plugin, theme or custom code, there are chances that the website might break leading to downtime for your users, or even cause irreparable damage to your website like loss of content and data.

Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform that enables you to run containerized workloads without managing the underlying infrastructure. Dynamic sessions adds the ability to execute untrusted code in secure, sandboxed environments at scale.
 
When you build applications that run code or commands from untrusted sources, you must ensure that the code runs in its own isolated environment. Dynamic sessions provide secure, ephemeral sandboxes called "sessions" for running potentially malicious code. Each session runs in its own Hyper-V virtualization boundary — ensuring complete isolation from other sessions and resources.

Performance testing is not always a walk in the park. Quite often, it can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex and dynamic web applications that rely on JavaScript, AJAX, or other browser-side technologies.
For testing browser latencies under heavy load, JMeter has a built-in component called Web Driver Sampler, which allows testers to use Selenium WebDriver to simulate real browser actions and interactions with web elements. Web Driver Sampler can complement the HTTP Request Sampler, which sends HTTP requests to the server, by adding the browser-side perspective and measuring the rendering time, page load time, and user actions. By running JMeter scripts on Azure Load Testing, you can reliably execute your performance tests without worrying …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Containerization has become the prevailing choice for hosting and managing Java applications, due to its unmatched portability, consistency, and scalability benefits. However, by default, when running a Java app inside containers, the JVM assumes that the OS memory is shared among multiple applications, so it conservatively claims memory for the Java application.
With Azure Container Apps, we can optimize memory allocation by simply dedicating more memory to the Java app, since only one Java application can run inside a container. This feature is called automatic memory fit, which is enabled by default when you deploy from Java source code or artifact.
In this blog we’ll cover the following:

Redis is an extremely popular in-memory data store that is used as a cache, session store, message broker, and more. One of the features that makes Redis really useful is the ability to set a time-to-live (TTL) value for any key. A key with a TTL value will be automatically deleted from Redis when the TTL expires. This helps reduce memory usage and ensure data freshness.
 
For instance, you might be storing information like inventory or pricing for your e-commerce site in Redis. This is a perfect application for caching in Redis. This type of data will be queried constantly and serving it directly from a database will either slow down your application or make your database implementation very expensive to handle the load!

What is it
When a user authenticates to an app (e.g., MS Entra ID application), a custom claims provider can be used to add claims into the token. A custom claims provider is made up of a custom authentication extension that calls an external REST API (e.g., a Function App), to fetch claims from external systems (e.g., a Database). A custom claims provider can be assigned to one or many applications.
 
Claim: Please imagine it as features (or attributes) that belong to the end user. As it may involve sensitive information within the enterprise, the enterprise owner wishes to store this user information in the on-premises environment, while also hoping to retrieve and utilize it through the authentication process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Azure Monitor and App Service teams are happy to share that Application Insights integration with App Services for Python apps is now available for Public Preview. You can now easily monitor your Python apps on App Service without changing your code by leveraging auto-instrumentation that is integrated into the App Services platform.
 
This integration supports App Service deploy as code for Python versions 3.11 and lower. Deploy as container scenarios are not currently supported, but we plan to introduce this capability at a future date. We also plan to support Python 3.12 in the near future.
 
With this feature enabled, the App Service platform will instrument popular Python libraries in your code and automatically channel correlated application-level logs, metrics, and distributed tracing to your Application Insights resource. This will allow you to understand how your Python application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.
 
You can enable the feature at resource creation or from the App Insights blade after your App Service resource is created. Please review our documentation to learn more.
 
Turn On App Insights during App Service Resource Creation
 
When you create a new Python web application (version 3.11 and lower) using the "Deploy as code" option, you can select "Yes" on the "Enable Application Insights" in the "Monitoring" tab. If you select "Yes", then your non-containerized Python application will pipe data to an Application Insights resource allowing you to automatically monitor your workloads.
 

 
 
Turn On App Insights after App Service Resource Creation
 
Open your App Service application in the portal and go to the App Insights menu item.

Select "Enable" in the toggle under "Application Insights (Preview)"
Select a location for your Application Insights resource (It’s suggested to create the resource in the same region as the Web App.)]]></summary>

Over at the Val Town Blog, I wrote about how searching source code is a pretty
hard problem. It was pretty
well-received: I confirmed that yes, it’s a pretty hard problem. We’re really
trying not to write a search engine, but it’s tempting, maybe just
to tinker with Tantivy.

This is a big year for running, so far. My first race of the year is
complete - the Brooklyn Half Marathon. I ran 1:36:21 (7:21/mi pace) –
a time that just squeaks past my previous personal best. Felt pretty good!
My pacing was good until it wasn’t: need to work on endurance past the eleven
mile mark.
I have two 5Ks lined up, but might try running another longer race,
because beating my half marathon PR seems more achievable than
beating my 5K PR, whic…]]></summary>

Advanced Account Security
On select pages, Kagi will now ask you to confirm with your password or 2FA code (if configured) where sensitive actions or information may be present. This primarily applies to billing-related areas, such as accessing your invoices or switching plans.
