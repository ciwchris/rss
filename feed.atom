But what is it, and why is it better than API keys? Let's try to answer that question and show a practical example of how to use managed identities in Azure.

What is managed identity?

It's a feature in Azure that allows applications to authenticate to cloud services securely without needing to manage credentials like API keys. 

Managed identity in Azure works by providing an *automatically managed identity* for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authent…]]></summary>

This means that even if we can use identity-based host connections to replace the AzureWebjobsStorage, which uses a SAS token, we still cannot remove the file share connection strings (WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING) that also rely on a SAS token. Therefore, we are unable to disable the SAS token in the storage account.
 
For now, when creating function apps in the consumption/EP plan, we have the option to create an app without Azure File. In this scenario, we can bypass the SAS token requirement for Azure Files and solely utilize managed identity to access the storage account.
 
 
To run your app without relying on Azure file share, you need to fulfill the following requirements:

Now, let's slightly move the focus to Azure Functions app. How can you containerise the Azure Functions app? Fortunately, Azure Functions Core Tools natively support it with Dockerfile. But is the Dockerfile the only option for containerising your .NET-based Azure Functions apps? Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how Azure Functions apps can be containerised both with and without Dockerfile.
 

You can find a sample code from this GitHub repository.

 
Prerequisites
 
There are a few prerequisites to containerise .NET-based function apps effectively.

Azure Functions Core Tools
Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code + C# Dev Kit + Azure Functions

Previously, ARO clusters were limited to 62 worker nodes due to having only one IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with the cluster's load balancer. By enabling multiple IP addresses for the load balancer, we have removed this bottleneck, offering organizations greater flexibility in expanding their deployments.

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight, pub/sub messaging protocol designed specifically for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. It's an ideal choice for IoT (Internet of Things) devices and other scenarios where resources are limited. Development teams even build chat apps using MQTT protocol.

WebJobs are a feature of Azure App Service that allows you to run background tasks or scripts in your App Service. They are particularly useful for executing jobs such as scheduled tasks, data processing, or background maintenance tasks. WebJobs can run continuously, on-demand, or on a scheduled basis, and they can be written in various programming languages.
The goal of this blog post is to guide you through the process of setting up and deploying a WebJob on an Azure App Service running Linux. We will walk you through the necessary steps to create and deploy a WebJob, configure its settings, and manage it effectively. By the end of this blog, you will have a working WebJob integrated into your Azure App Service, capable of performing background tasks or processing jobs as ne…]]></summary>

For the workload profile container app, private link support is not yet available. This is because the “Private Link Service does not support a load balancer that has an IP-based backend pool, which is used in Consumption + Dedicated environments (Workload Profile)”. Although we have a roadmap to implement this feature (Private link support for Workload Profiles · Azure Container Apps Roadmap), there is currently no ETA.
 
In the meantime, I will guide you on how to integrate a workload profile container app with Azure Front Door using an Application Gateway. The architecture involves using the Application Gateway private link to connect to the Front Door, and placing the Application Gateway in the same VNET as the container app to achieve this integration.

That's a pretty scary statement, that means services are being misused most likely, data is actively being stolen and so on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building HTTP APIs, it can be tempting to synchronously run long-running tasks in a request handler. This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won't know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.
 
In this post, we'll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We'll create a simple API that implements the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job. This approach provides a much more robust and scalable solution for long-running tasks.

Incorporating benchmark testing of your Microsoft Azure API Management services into your software delivery process provides several important benefits:
 

It establishes performance baseline as a known, quantifiable starting point against which future results can be compared.
It identifies performance regressions so that you can pinpoint changes or integrations that may be causing performance degradation or hindering scalability — in effect helping you to identify whi…]]></summary>

Steps:

Create an App registration in Microsoft Entra.


 
 
 

After creation, note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID, which will be used later.


 
 

Create a Linux web app in Azure Portal and use Node.js.


 
 

After creation, note down the App Name, which will be used later.


 
 
 

Download the sample code in your development environment:

 
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-docs-code-javascript.git
 
 
 

You can use VS Code to open the react-spa subfolder.

 
 
 

Edit src/authConfig.js and make the corresponding modifications:




clientId
Specify the Application (client) ID obtained in step 2


authority
Fill in the Directory (tenant) ID obtained in step 2 in the specified format. (https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>)


redirectUri
Fill in the App Name obtained in step 4 in the specified format. (https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback)




 
 
 

Run the following command to install the relevant packages:

 
npm install
 
 

Run the following command to compile the project. After execution, a build subfolder will be created.

 
npm run build
 
 

Create or modify build/.deployment with the following content:

 
[config]
SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=false
 

 
 
 

Publish your project, specifying the build subfolder during the publishing process.




 
 

After publishing, go back to the App registration in Microsoft Entra, find Authentication, create a Platform, specify Single-Page Application, and fill in the value of authority from Step 7.


 
 
 

Go back to the project, navigate to Configuration, and specify the Startup Command as follows:

 
pm2 serve /home/site/wwwroot --no-daemon --spa
 

 
 
 

After restarting the web app, you can visit your webpage using a browser.

What is an NSG?
Network Security Groups (NSGs) are crucial for maintaining robust security and efficient traffic management within cloud environments. They provide essential control over network traffic by defining rules that determine which IP addresses, ports, and protocols are allowed or denied, thereby safeguarding resources from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

Starting August 1st, Azure Container Registry (ACR) will update its behavior regarding the deletion and re-creation of registries. ACR will prevent the reuse of a subdomain name, e.g. abc123.azurecr.io, for a period after the resource is deleted. This updated behavior enhances security and prevents subdomain takeovers by automatically reserving registry names during the creation of the ACR resource, without requiring any additional action or configuration from customers. 
 
Once a resource name is reserved, it remains reserved from the moment of creation and throughout an extended period following the deletion of the resource (referred to as a cooldown period). During this cooldown period, subscriptions not associated with the original Azure AD tenant that created the reso…]]></summary>

a map on a webpage - something that Iván is skeptical of and I am as well.
