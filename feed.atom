WP Admin: Also called the backend, admin panel, or admin dashboard, this is the admin area where you can manage your website. You can edit posts and pages, install themes and plugins, add or remove users, and change website settings.
Frontend: This is the section which is accessible to your users. This is where your users can read blog posts, make purchases, or participate in a forum, depending on the kind of website you build using WordPress.

A relatively common problem is that the WP Admin has low performance even when the frontend works fast for your users. Most performance enhancements that you do makes only your frontend faster. This makes it difficult …]]></summary>

When we create App Service Certificate (Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn) in Azure Portal, sometime we are not using it in the App Service but use it for Azure VM or on-prem VM. Moreover, we will use it in some Azure resources (such as upload the certificate to Azure Application Gateway).
 
However, after you export the App Service Certificate from Azure Portal, when you are going to upload it to Azure Application Gateway or use it in the Azure VM or on-prem VM, you would find out sometimes it would need the "password". But you don't know what the password is for the …]]></summary>

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the managed Kubernetes offering from Azure, allows customers to offload the operational overhead to Azure, thus letting the user focus primarily on their workloads and business logic. We are seeing two sets of user trends along the Kubernetes adoption curve. First, organizations that are already using containers and/or Kubernetes in their on-premises and cloud environments are looking to AKS to reduce their operational burden and leverage the Azure cloud ecosystem. Secondly, we also see organizations earlier in the adoption cycle that are looking to experiment and discover Kubernetes’ fit…]]></summary>

I only finished one book this month - Meet Us By The Roaring Sea,
which was part of my book club. It was great, and gets me off
on a good footing for reading a lot more fiction in 2023.
I really liked Brian Potter’s weekend roundup,
which covers a lot of funky building technology –
wooden potash storage, robotically-assembled buildings, 3D
printed houses.
I have mixed feelings about the layoffs explainer from prof

And I haven’t really given an update on Placemark, the product and business, in a while. Writing about an operating business is a different thing that writing feature announcements or essays about technology: the ramifications of honesty, spin, or disclosure are so much more vast and unpredictable. This is why we often learn about people’s trials or a company’s struggles only years later, but at the time everyone exudes confidence.
But, having drafted something about this a few times and edited myself into knots, I figure it’s better to just write something. The best writing always comes after I’ve scrapped a draft anyway.

Val.town is a system for programming in the small, for writing short programs in TypeScript that can link together into something larger. It’s for writing that scheduled web scraper or basic API that you wanted to make but didn’t want to add to your pile of servers on AWS or GCP. It’s already a lot of fun to use, and is going to keep getting better.

Placemark lives. It’s still getting better every week. It’s been about two years since I formally started it, and it’s grown into a great product with the help of supportive and creative customers. I’ve been relatively quiet about Placemark-the-business, despite writing a steady flow of blog posts on features & improvements on placemark.io. But, soon - I’ll publish a state of Placemark in the near future.
I’m tremendously excited about Val.town. It’s a small team in Brooklyn and Seattle, with lots of creative energy. I think we’ll be able to take this opportunity and make something great, something that in retrospect always should have existed.]]></summary>

Again, you do not have to install these components yourself. All you need to do is enable and/or configure your container app to use these components.
 
In this blog, we will see how can we scale Container Apps based on Redis Streams with the Azure managed instance of Redis, i.e. Azure Cache for Redis. We will be referring to the KEDA trigger specification for Redis Streams (Scale applications based on Redis Streams) to configure our Container App. This specification describes the Redis-s…]]></summary>

Some of you may have learned about these new storage providers during the annual Build conference and/or from this preview announcement blog post.
 
Durable Functions enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the serverless Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. We believe the new storage providers will enable a host of new scenarios for apps using Durable Functions because they allow apps to run at a higher scale, with greater price-performance efficiency, and with more portability compared to the default option Azure Storage.

When load testing an application, this generally is the first step in the user journey.  Supplying client credentials through a UI is not possible when load testing an application, so is evaluating how to implement specific authentication flows available on Azure, as they can be tedious and time consuming as well.
Within this series, we will cover the authentication flows and scenarios that are possible with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the identity provider.

Cloud computing revolutionized how a business can establish its digital presence. Nowadays, by leveraging cloud features such as scalability, elasticity, and convenience, businesses can deploy, grow, or test an environment in every corner of the world without worrying about building the required infrastructure.
 
Unlike the traditional model, which was based on notifying the service provider to set up the resources for customers in advance, in an on-demand model, cloud providers implement application programming interfaces (API) that can be used by customers to deploy resources on demand. This allows the customer to access an unlimited amount of resources on-demand and only pay for the resources they use without worrying about th…]]></summary>

addition to this, a new set of php-legacy packages have been
introduced. These will follow the oldest but still actively supported
PHP branch. This enables users to install the latest version but also
introduces the option to use third party applications that might rely
on an older version. Both branches will be kept up to date following
our rolling release model. php and php-legacy can be installed at the
same time as the latter uses a -legacy suffix for its binaries and
configuration files.
In addition to this, the php7 packages have been removed as they
reached end of life. The imap extension will no longer be provided as
it relies on the c-client library which has been abandoned for many

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note that official support for PHP 8 will only be available on Linux, as a result of this App Service will only support PHP 8 on Apps Service Linux instances. For additional information on this topic: PHP on App Service, php.internals: Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows.
 
This article will demonstrate on how to use PHP 8 for App Service Windows, since there would be no official support from Microsoft for it, please use at your own risk.
 
Generally, we are following this post: How to use a Custom PHP runtime for App Service Windows - (azureossd.github.io) to download a custom PHP runtime and map Handler for it.
 
1. Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.

 
2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:

 
3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:
 
 
mkdir php
curl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\php.zip
cd php
unzip php.zip
 
 


 
4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is "*.php", the Script processor is "C:\home\php\php-cgi.exe". Then save it. All the configuration is done.

 
5. To verify it, we can create an "index.php" file under C:\home\site\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:
 
<?
phpinfo();
 
 

 
I hope you enjoy it.]]></summary>

Popular "orb" icon in results, has been replaced by a "shield" icon in a slight redesign to accomodate for the upcoming AI tools.
Added an icon to host links to manipulate the results. Currently it is "Open in Web Archive" and "More from this site". We will be adding more in the future.
Maps: UI design improvements to Directions/Navigation Controls (button icons/spacing/padding/etc)
Maps: Addition of "My Location" button, for setting starting-point as user-location
Maps: Addition of a "Drop Pin" button, for manually setting a start point via mouse


Improved
You can't directly switch from a lense to a non-All search (e.g. Images, News) with JS disabled #61 @gesumin
Plan selection does not work without JS on onboarding


Fixed
Zero results for “Best Headphones” – is shopping search broken right now? #1109 @quinncom
Search results sections do not all honor personalized results settings #1133 @ryandary

However, it is still in Preview status, so it is not recommended to use it in Production environment. There are also some limitations. In this article, I would like to use a sample app service to introduce a method to do the same thing by using nginx and custom docker container.
 
Note
The current method does not obey the recommendation of Docker that a docker container should host only one service, and we actually recommend customers use Azure Container App for hosting multiple applications.
 
Design
We will create a Docker container to have nginx installed and use it as a reverse proxy to redirect the request from external to different applications.
