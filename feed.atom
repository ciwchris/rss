        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Microsoft Ignite 2023, we unveiled our ongoing work on implementing a Sidecar pattern for Linux App Service. While the complete implementation is still in progress, we want to provide you with a sneak peek into this upcoming feature. Moreover, we'll guide you on how to start using it immediately (with certain restrictions) on Linux App Service. In this blog post, we'll delve into the Sidecar pattern, its significance, and practical ways to leverage it for your applications.
What is the Sidecar Pattern
Applications and services often require related functionality, such as monitoring, logging, configuration, and networking services. These peripheral tasks can be implemented as separate components or services, built using different languages and technologies.

I agree with his response 100%: it’d be lovely if we didn’t have
to cart in a big framework just to create a tooltip,

that’s where Web Components will fit in.

Durable Functions enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. 
 
Distributed Tracing allows you to correlate operations together and track requests between services. This is especially useful for Durable Functions apps as they coordinate work across multiple services and VMs. 
 
 
Distributed Tracing V2 Improvements 
 
The first implementation of Distributed Tracing supported only the .NET in-process model and the Azure Storage backend. The V1 implementation is still in an experimental state. Distributed Tracing V2, on the other hand, is not an experimental feature and supports all Durable Functions lang…]]></summary>

balance and whether it’s a good or bad idea to work hard when you’re
young. Like most of these recurring debates, it has generated two
opposite archetypes:
The anti-capitalist tells the young worker not to trust HR and not to
buy into the idea of work as family. Your employment contract is the
only thing that binds you to your job, and that can be terminated on
either side. Arrive at 9, leave at 5. Prioritize the family.
The hustlebro tells you to wake up at 7am and get to work, and
give it your all. Hustle, and earn as much as you can, build those
connections. You can get work-life balance when you’re older, your
early 20s are the time for making that cheddar and staying

Recently, I've been building an app using .NET Aspire which I'm using PostgreSQL as the database and Azure Storage Blobs and Queues in.
.NET Aspire is awesome for this, as you can setup a developer inner loop super simply with the components that ship, and the nice thing about this is that locally PostgreSQL is run in a Docker container and Azure Storage uses the Azurite storage emulator (which also happens to run in a container).
The problem with this is that when you restart your app, you lose all the data in the database and storage emulator, since they are started fresh each time.

However, you can also download or export the test results, build your own dashboards and reporting, for example, using Microsoft Excel or Power BI. You can also use JMeter backend listeners to write the results to a data store of your choice and analyze the data.
When you use the download results option, the ALT service splits the results into one CSV file per engine. This ensures that the file size is not huge, and it is easy to open the files in tools like notepad, excel to analyze the data. In cases where your input data is split across test engines, you can pick the results file for a specific engine and analyze.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service supports HTTP 2.0. The major advance of HTTP/1.1 was the use of persistent connections to service multiple requests in a row. In HTTP/2, a persistent connection can be used to service multiple simultaneous requests. 
 
This blog will demonstrate how you can send HTTP 2.0 Request to app service for testing using C#:
 
Step 1:
Go to > App Service > Configuration > Enable HTTP 2.0

 
Step 2:
Create a .Net Core Console Application / Web Application as per requirement . In this example I have taken a .Net Core Console Application:
 
 
var client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://<>.azurewebsites.net") };

            Console.WriteLine("Sending HTTP 2.0 Request.");

            // HTTP/2 request
            using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "/") { Version = new Version(2, 0) })
            using (var response = await client.SendAsync(request))
                Console.WriteLine(response);


 
 
The HTTPClient class has DefaultRequestVersion property with which you can set the default version of the requests as below:
 
 
var SecondRequest = new HttpClient()
            {
                BaseAddress = new Uri("https://<>.azurewebsites.net"),
                DefaultRequestVersion = new Version(2, 0)
            };

            // HTTP/2 is default
            using (var response = await SecondRequest.GetAsync("/"))
                Console.WriteLine(response);
 
 
You should be able to see a successful HTTP Response once the code executes:
 

 
For more information you can refer the below documents:

HttpClient Class (System.Net.Http) | Microsoft Learn
HttpClient.DefaultRequestVersion Property (System.Net.Http) | Microsoft Learn

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Placemark is now open source! In short:
MIT license
TypeScript codebase
Contributions welcome
If you want to learn about the open source codebase, I wrote quite a few blog posts about the architecture that are now archived in the docs repo. The README has been expanded, to some extent, with setup details.
I’d really love if folks tried out and made use of it. You can really do anything - use it as the foundation for your own application, pull parts into standalone modules, you name it.
→ Placemark repository
Details:
The public repository has a flat git history, to maximize security and keep my silly
private commit messages out of the public web. I made 1,439 commits, 406,048++ 218,320–
throughout the year. Adam Krebs contributed to
the feature table element as well (3 commits, 570++ 279–)
It’s complicated. I know it’s a fairly complicated codebase, and also that it is need
of an update to Next.js. It’s also built on Blitz, which,
while I love it, is getting lapped by tools like tRPC,
and could be replaced with them.
I’ll be moving more issues from the private repository to the public one
over time.
The Placemark website is staying online as-is
for a little while, until I can archive some pages that are hard to archive. Any advice
for how to archive a Webflow site would be much appreciated: their options
are really limited.
Have any other questions, or comments? Ask me. The discussions board
is probably a good place to do that, if you have something private you need to
ask, my email is on this site.
I’m doing great! Val Town is going really well, and
I’m excited for Placemark’s new era. Don’t worry about me.]]></summary>

When it comes to website security, one important step is to add a custom domain and connect it with a TLS/SSL certificate. This not only enhances the trust and safety of your website but also ensures that your visitors' information is encrypted and protected. Azure App Service provides TLS bindings for the most common custom domains. This blog discusses the special domain and certificate binding situations in Azure App Service for IDN hostnames.

What is an IDN hostname?
An IDN hostname is a domain name that includes characters used in the local representation of languages not written with the basic Latin alphabet "a-z". These characters can be Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Cyrillic, Tamil, Hindi, and more.

Organisations are increasingly understanding the value that machine learning and artificial intelligence can deliver across all industries. Subsequently those organisations are also evaluating how to move machine learning projects from experimental stages to production. This surge in AI/ML interest also comes at a time when businesses are prioritising cost optimization of new and existing technology projects.
 
Frequently customers I am speaking too are asking how they can deploy reliable, robust and cost effective deployment platforms for moving machine learning models into production.

Turning on the Savings Plan will not mess with your current set-ups or apps. You just get the savings while everything runs as usual. If you are running big apps, this plan can optimize your investments. It brings down your overall costs for using Azure Spring Apps Enterprise.

No prior expertise in testing tools is required – just navigate to the portal, input your HTTP requests, and you're all set! 
With this new experience you can specify the endpoint, HTTP method, headers, query parameters, or just enter cURL commands effortlessly. But that's not all you also have additional functionalities with this.
