It’s an incredible book that I’ll\nprobably re-read soon, because the central conflict that it sets out feels so thoroughly\ndeadlocked, unresolvable, and important - the interplay between privacy, safety, police\npower, and freedom.\nI don’t agree with all of it, but Jon McLoone’s explanatio of why Wolfram is not open source\nresonated strongly with me. Placemark, as I’ve said before, is not planning on being\nopen source, though components of the application will be released. Some of my reasoning\nlines up with Wolfram’s pretty precisely. The central piece for me, I think, is just\nwhat the community means - where communities come from, how they agree on what they\ndo, how they collect and disperse. Magical thinking around what constitutes\ncommunity and how it operates is my biggest gripe about open source ideology in this\nday and age: too many people happily ignore the top-heaviness of some communities,\nor don’t think about where the direction, leadership, contributions, and standards\ncome from.\nWatching\n\nWatch Vampire’s Kiss. That is all.\nExpect to see in the new year: more, probably shorter, blog posts. More photos.\nAnd Placemark, out in the wild.",
