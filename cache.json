          "description": "We are introducing a change in JDK/JRE packages of our distro. This is\ntriggered from the way a JRE is build in modern versions of Java (>9). We are\nintroducing this change in Java 21.\nTo sum it up instead of having JDK and JRE packages coexist in the same system\nwe will be making them conflict. The JDK variant package includes the runtime\nenvironment to execute Java applications so if one needs compilation and\nruntime of Java they need only the JDK package in the future. If, on the other\nhand, they need just runtime of Java then JRE (or jre-headless) will work.\nThis will (potentially) require a manual user action during upgrade:\nIf you have both JDK and JRE installed you can manually install the JDK\nwith pacman -Syu jdk-openjdk and this removes the JRE related packages.\nIf you have both JRE and JRE-headless you will need to choose one of\nthem and install it manually since they would conflict each other now.\nIf you only have one of the JDK/JRE/JRE-headless pacman should resolve\ndependencies normally and no action is needed.\nAt the moment this is only valid for the upcoming JDK 21 release.",

Building it was incredibly fun.\nFailing to find success and sustainability was pretty hard but it’s okay.\nHere’s the plan:\nToday I’m turning off signups to Placemark.io.\nPlacemark is free for all existing customers until January 19, 2023,\nat which point the servers will be shut down.\nLater in January, I’ll release the full source code to the site. This might\ntake a little while. It’s a big application.\nBuilding Placemark was an incredible experience. I learned a ton and got to\nknow a lot of new people in the process. I’m really proud of what it turned\nout to be, even if the business fell short of my goals.\nI built, coded, designed, documented, marketed, and ran Placemark. It had paying\ncustomers who used it for real-world purposes. It shipped, and it was a real business.\nWith luck, it’ll become something as an open source project – either maintained,\nor used as inspiration and fuel for future projects. I’m happy to create more\nvalue than I capture.\nThere’s more to write about what I learned, but for now I just want to say\nthanks to everyone who gave it a shot, and all of the people who were\nsupportive along the way - special thanks to\nGabriel Coch, Aaron Boodman,\nBrian Lovin, Adam Krebs,\nPrerna Nadathur, and many others.",

          "description": "With containers becoming the new normal for cloud operations, the adoption of Kubernetes, by cloud native and enterprise organizations alike, continues to skyrocket. The 2022 CNCF Annual Survey touts Kubernetes as “the ‘operating system’ of the cloud,” as it has become the platform for running almost any kind of workload. Cost optimization, however, continues to be a top challenge for organizations regardless of their level of maturity and experience adopting Kubernetes.\n \nOrganizations are looking for ways to reduce cloud spend, but without cost visibility and allocation tooling it is difficult to know where to start and what to optimize. In the 2023 State of FinOps Survey, cost allocation remained the #1 most prioritized FinOps capability by practitioners. Additionally, “creating visibil…",

If you are working with many App Service plans, managing the subnets can be an unnecessary administrative task.

With MPSJ you can join a virtual network/subnet in a different subscription, but all App Service plan joining a specific subnet must be in the same subscription.\n \nYou may still want to use individual subnets if you plan to differentiate on Network Security…",
