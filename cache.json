In honor of growing older, this is sort of a super-cut of a bunch of different drafts that I previously judged to be too odd or personal.\nConstants\nThe idea has been rephrased a million times in different medias, but I like DFW’s framing of “whatever you worship will eat you alive”. A decade ago, I honestly believed I’d learn a few things, achieve what I wanted, and settle into a sort of non-striving creative flow for the rest of my days. I was – and am – avoiding flashy purchases or other obvious signs that I’m hopping on the Hedonic treadmill. But it didn’t work. The treadmill isn’t necessarily about money or fame.

Individuals aged 68 and above who were physically active throughout their life have healthier aging muscle that has superior function and is more resistant to fatigue compared to inactive individuals, both young and old. This is the first study to investigate muscle, stem cell and nerve activity in humans. The researchers from University of Copenhagen, Denmark, found that elderly individuals who keep physically active throughout their adult life, whether by taking part in resistance exercise, ball games, racket sports, swimming, cycling, running and/or rowing had a greater number of muscle stem cells, otherwise known as satellite cells in their muscle.

In the children with binge eating disorder, researchers saw elevations in gray matter density in areas that are typically 'pruned' during healthy brain development.

This is the first study to investigate muscle, stem cell and nerve activity in humans.

          "description": "Red Hat JBoss EAP on Azure App Service has been generally available since June 2021 and is jointly supported by Red Hat and Microsoft. Today, we are announcing the Public Preview of support for clustered deployments of JBoss EAP on App Service. This means customers can run Java EE, Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications which use stateful session beans, distributed transactions, and similar features that require instance-to-instance communication or high availability. Previously, individual JBoss EAP instances on App Service could not communicate with one another; with this update all nodes can communicate over a virtual network. Read on to learn more!\n \nCreate a JBoss EAP cluster on App Service now and deploy a stateful application!\n \nAbout JBoss EAP Clustering\nIn JBoss EAP, clustering …",

If we can, we just simply hand over our PoC repository to developers so that they just run it directly from there.\"\n\n \nAlthough two challenges exist to achieve this idea, if we can combine both challenges, devs can autopilot everything from the resource creating to the app deployment, which will result in improving the development experiences. Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to offer the autopilot feature for your application repository.\n \n\nYou can download the sample code from this repository.\n\n \nArchitecture\n \n\nFront-end Application: Blazor Web Assembly\nBack-end Application: Azure Functions\nDatabase: Cosmos DB\n\n \nBoth front-end a…",
