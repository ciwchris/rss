It was good - of course\nit was good, it won a Pulitzer.

That’s jwz of Mozilla, Netscape Navigator, and DNA Lounge.\nNick Maggiulli’s How Much Growth Can You Expect?\nwas an interesting read, but even moreso I appreciate that all of his\nanalysis is open source on GitHub\nand serves as a neat example learning a bit of R.\nListening\n\nNot a big month for new music, the only thing that really hooked me in November was\nPavane pour une infante défunte by Maurice Ravel.\nI’m trying to learn it on guitar (like most classical, there’s a great tab\non classtab), but the original version on piano is so lovely.\nWatching\n\nSerial Mom was, I think, the first John\nWaters film I’ve watched.

Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.",

While previous research has associated food insecurity with a range of health issues including diabetes, obesity and hypertension, this study showed a connection over time, suggesting a causal relationship. Researchers analyzed data on nearly 4,000 people from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. They found that adults ages 24-32 who said they'd been worried about food running out in the last year showed greater incidence of diabetes, either through blood glucose tests or self-reports, at ages 32-42, compared to those who did not report food insecurity risk.",

          "description": "Running load tests against private endpoints is a common scenario. The endpoints may be sitting behind a firewall, or they may be only accessible from within a virtual network, or they may not have been made public yet as they are under development. Microsoft Azure Load Testing supports private endpoint load testing using VNet injection. This injects the load generating virtual machines into the same virtual network as your private endpoint.\nAzure Load Testing support for private endpoint load testing is currently available in seven regions with expansion on the horizon. What if you want to initiate a load test from a different region than where your application is? What if the virtual network sits in a different subscription? Or if private endpoint load testing is not supported yet in you…",

Having these paths simplifies the development process, lets developers focus on their applications instead of infrastructure and speeds time to production. Microsoft and VMware have partnered to make Azure Spring Apps a golden path for deploying and scaling Spring applications in the cloud. And with new capabilities like the scale to zero and developer productivity enhancements, Azure Spring Apps now offers an even more economical and optimized route to get your Spring applications into production.\n \n1 Start from zero and scale to zero – consumption plan\n \nWe are introducing a new consumption pricing plan for Azure Spring Apps – you can start from zero and sca…",

It allows safe and convenient design, management, and improvement of infrastructure as code. If you are working in a relatively small team and running DevOps on your own, you can embed Terraform script in your CI/CD pipeline like GitHub Actions to manage everything as code from the provision and config cloud resources to build, test and deploy the app on it. If you are working in an enterprise with a dedicated infrastructure team, you might have that infrastructure team provisioning virtual networks, databases, and compute resources with Terraform, …",
