          "description": "You likely heard of or currently use oh-my-zsh for your terminal on Linux or Mac, or WSL on Windows. It might also be possible to have heard of or currently use oh-my-posh for your PowerShell. Azure offers Azure Cloud Shell service, which uses both Bash Shell and PowerShell by default. Therefore, if you want either oh-my-zsh or oh-my-posh, or both, you should configure it by yourself.\n \nThroughout this post, I'm going to show how to configure your shell environment for both.\n \n\nThis GitHub repository provides the working shell script source for your reference.\n\n \nFor oh-my-zsh\n \nLet's configure oh-my-zsh on your Azure Cloud Shell. Make sure that you see the Bash Shell prompt. If not, enter the bash command to switch your prompt to Bash.\n \n\n\nInstall oh-my-zsh.\nsh -c \"$(curl -fsSL \\\n    http…",

If you are looking for how to implement it in Windows App Service, you may refer to this post: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-connect-azure-sql-database-from-azure-app-service-windows/ba-p/2873397.\nNote that Azure Active Directory managed identity authentication method was added in ODBC Driver since version 17.3.1.1 for both system-assigned and user-assigned identities. In Azure blessed image for Python Function, the ODBC Driver version is 17.8. Which makes it possible to leverage this feature in Linux App Service.\n\nBriefly, this post will provide you a step to step guidance with sample code and introduction on the authentication…",

          "description": "Today, we are excited to announce the general availability of all the features to secure communications end-to-end for Spring Boot apps – in a Zero Trust environment. You can secure communications end-to-end or terminate transport-level security at any communication point for Spring Boot apps. You can also automate the provisioning and configuration for all the Azure resources needed for securing communications.\n \nImplementing secure communications as part of your solution architecture can be challenging. Many customers manually rotate their certificates or create their own solutions to automate provisioning and configuration. Even then, there is still data exfiltration risk – say unauthorized copying or transfer of data from server systems. With Azure Spring Cloud, all of this is handled …",

          "description": "A while ago, I wrote a blog post about Azure DevOps Pipelines refactoring technics. GitHub Actions is also suitable for building CI/CD pipelines. But, compared to Azure DevOps, there are many spaces to achieve the same efficiency level as Azure DevOps. GitHub Actions has recently released a new feature called \"Reusable Workflows\", which you can reduce the refactoring concerns. Throughout this post, I'm going to refactor the existing Azure Static Web Apps CI/CD pipeline workflows, using the \"reusable workflows\" feature of GitHub Actions.\n \nWorkflow for Azure Static Web Apps\n \nWhile provisioning an Azure Static Web Apps (ASWA) instance, GitHub Actions workflow is automatically generated by default.
