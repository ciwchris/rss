This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice, or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…",

An incubation project means that it is considered stable and successfully being used in production, at scale by enterprises. Backstage is a platform for building developer portals which act as an operational platform between developers and the services they need to deploy. Developer portals can accelerate developer velocity providing push button deployment of production ready services and infrastructure.\n \nIn this Walkthrough we will learn about what Backstage is as well as how we can build and deploy it on Azure using multiple services including:\n \n\nAzure Kubernetes Service\nAzure Container Registry\nAzure Database for PostgreSQL \nMicrosoft Entra ID\n\nBackstage Feat…",
