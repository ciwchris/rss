Even though the new texlive-basic replaces the old texlive-core, many of the texlive-core contents (including language specific files) are now split between different packages. To find out which Arch package contains a specific CTAN package, you can use the tlmgr utility, eg.\n$ tlmgr info euler | grep collection\ncollection:  collection-latexrecommended\n\nwhich means the euler CTAN package is contained in texlive-latexrecommended. You may also use pacman -F to query for specific files.\nA new metapackage texlive-meta is available to install all subpackages (except for language specific ones), and the new texlive-doc package provides the full documentation for offline use.",

I especially love this\ntrack â€˜Bubbles,â€™ which really could be a radio hit.\nIâ€™ve also been listening to Spellcaster: The Fall of Sam Bankman-Fried,\nwhich will probably be only one of 20 podcasts, TV shows,\nmovies, books about SBF. But itâ€™s pretty good.\nBloomberg puts out good content!\nReading\nI read Capital Without Borders,\nwhich is a great add-on if youâ€™ve already read Pikettyâ€™s Capital\nor anything by Zucman, Saez, etc. It really gives you a level-headed\nperspective of what exactly the wealth management industry does,\nand how it affects the word.\nRight now, Iâ€™m reading Crabgrass Kingdom,\nwhich I found via the New York Times piece on Vienna.\nItâ€™s pretty good, but unfortunately kind of dated - when it was\npublished in the 80s, US cities hadnâ€™t started their arc back\ntoward growth and power.

          "description": "Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.\nÂ \nHere are the steps to create a preview environment:\nÂ \n1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it \"dev\".\n\n\nÂ \n2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include \"dev\" in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.\n\nÂ \n3. Set \"production_branch\" to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.\n\nÂ \n4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named 'dev' for the dev branch.\n\nÂ \n5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the \"deployment_environment\" to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.\n\nÂ \n\nÂ \nThe main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named.Â \nÂ \nOverall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment. The choice of environment type typically depends on the specific needs and development process of your project.",

          "description": "Encrypting data at rest is a primary step in securing a Kubernetes cluster. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.\nFor clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.",

This can be achieved by using TLS/SSL binding, which encrypts data transmitted to and from the website, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is protected. With this setup, users can access the website via a custom domain name, which adds an extra layer of professionalism and branding to the site.\nÂ \nIssue:\nThe users are not able to purchase and bind the app service certificate for their app service having a custom domain with a special character from Azure Portal.\nÂ \nSolution andÂ recommendations:\n\nAzure by default does not provide the facility to purchase the custom domain with the special character except periods and dashes.\n\nÂ \n\n\nThe user can purchase the custom domain outside Azure with special characters apart from periods and dashes.\nIn this case, the user will not be able to purchase the App Service Certificate from Azure with the custom domain consists a special character.\nTo purchase and bind the Certificate with such domain from Azure Portal, the custom domain first needs to be converted to its Punny code using the below converter:\n\nÂ \nPunycode converter (IDN converter), Punycode to Unicode :wrench:(punycoder.com)\n\nÂ \n\nPurchase the certificate with the Punny code custom domain and bind the certificate with the app service custom domain.\n\nAdd and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn\nÂ \n\nBrowse the app service to verify the SSL Certificate.\n\n\nÂ \nIf this helps you, do let me know via like and comments section, cheers!\nHappy Learning!\nÂ \nReferences :Create and Bind the custom domain contains special Unicode character in App Service Using Azure CLI.\nAdd and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn\naz appservice domain | Microsoft Learn\nList of Unicode characters - Wikipedia",
