It was good - of course\nit was good, it won a Pulitzer. I enjoyed it, but I wish I enjoyed reading it more,\nand I’m not sure why.\nThere have been hundreds of articles written about Twitter and FTX this month.\nI read a lot of both, and none of the FTX articles particularly stuck out,\nbut jwz’s writing has been a fun way to follow\nalong with some of the Mastodon/Twitter hype. That’s jwz of Mozilla, Netscape Navigator, and DNA Lounge.\nNick Maggiulli’s How Much Growth Can You Expect?\nwas an interesting read, but even moreso I appreciate that all of his\nanalysis is open source on GitHub\nand serves as a neat example learning a bit of R.\nListening\n\nNot a big month for new music, the only thing that really hooked me in November was\nPavane pour une infante défunte by Maurice Ravel.\nI’m trying to learn it on guitar (like most classical, there’s a great tab\non classtab), but the original version on piano is so lovely.\nWatching\n\nSerial Mom was, I think, the first John\nWaters film I’ve watched. Made me want to watch more from the back catalog.\n\nI’m continuing the mission of watching all the Nic Cage films - at\n18% so far - with Matchstick Men.\nIt’s one of the good ones.\nFinished Only Murders in The Building,\nwhich has a sort of extreme mass-appeal quality that’s become more boring than\nappealing lately.",

The methylation modification prevents tRF-3bs from silencing the expression of various genes in the unfolded protein response pathway in the cancer cells.",

In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.",
