You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.\nResponse time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining …",

          "description": "We're excited to announce the public preview of Azure Container Apps dynamic sessions. Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform that enables you to run containerized workloads without managing the underlying infrastructure. Dynamic sessions adds the ability to execute untrusted code in secure, sandboxed environments at scale.\n \nWhen you build applications that run code or commands from untrusted sources, you must ensure that the code runs in its own isolated environment. Dynamic sessions provide secure, ephemeral sandboxes called \"sessions\" for running potentially malicious code. Each session runs in its own Hyper-V virtualization boundary — ensuring complete isolation from other sessions and resources.\n \nDynamic sessions are ideal for running untrusted code in hostile multi-tenant sc…",
