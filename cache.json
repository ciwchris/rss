This is required as we have moved the [community] repository into [extra].\n$ pacman -Syu \"pacman>=6.0.2-7\"\n\nFor users of the now deprecated asp tool, you will need to switch to pkgctl:\n$ pacman -Syu \"devtools>=1:1.0.0-1\"\n$ pkgctl repo clone linux\n\nFor some more detailed instructions on how to obtain PKGBUILDs see the corresponding wiki article.\nFor packagers\nBefore starting, first uninstall devtools-git-poc and remove any repos from your filesystem that you cloned during the git proof-of-concept testing.\nMake sure you have both, an updated devtools and pacman on your system:\n$ pacman -Syu \"devtools>=1:1.0.0-1\" \"pacman>=6.0.2-7\"\n\nAdditionally clean up old chroots in /var/lib/archbuild/\n$ rm -rf /var/lib/archbuild/\n# or optionally, use the --clean option for pkgctl build *ONCE*\n$ pkgctl build --clean\n\nFor instruction on how to use pkgctl, please take a look at the \"How to be a packager\" wiki article and also consult the man page of each subcommand for further information:\n$ man pkgctl-build\n$ man pkgctl-repo-clone",

That’s why we so often spend so much effort to optimize the time between “File Save” and “Browser Reload”. A lot of time this loop happens entirely on our workstations, and we forgo the true end-to-end test of reviewing our changes on the platform that will later run the application -- doing so usually takes too long.\n \nThis gap between developing and running an application is often also the reason we rarely keep our applications up to date. Once an app is running and we’ve moved on to the next project, it’s often too tedious to come back.
