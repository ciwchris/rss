Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.",

The charts are the result of a research project spanning six continents and bringing together possibly the largest ever MRI datasets ever aggregated -- almost 125,000 brain scans from over a 100 different studies. Although not currently intended for clinical use, the team hopes the charts will become a routine clinical tool similar to how standardised paediatric growth charts are used.",

          "description": "App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.\n \nBefore talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss \"what is web.xml\"?\n \nJava web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.\n \nThe default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.\n \nWhen tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. \n \nIt instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.\nThere you specify:\n\nwhat servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to\nlisteners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)\nconfiguration parameters (context-params)\nerror pages, welcome files\nsecurity constraints\n\nBack to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:\n\n \nTo add a custom error page, please follow below steps:\n\nAdd <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page \"error.html\" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use \"/error.html\" in <location></location>.\n\n\n\nAdd your custom error in webapps folder.\n\n\n\nBuild and re-deploy the project to App Service.\nNow you will see the custom error page replace the default one.\n\n\n \nPlease kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.",

The App Service VNet integration feature enables your apps to access resources in or through a virtual network but doesn't grant inbound private access to your apps. For inbound access, you need private endpoints, which allow clients located in your private network to securely access your apps over Private Link, which eliminates exposure from the public internet.\n\nWith this update, you can use our lower-cost tiers and achieve the same level of security that you could previously only achieve with our high-end SKUs.\n\nLearn how to enable virtual network integration.\n\nLearn how to connect to a web app using an Azure Private endpoint.",
