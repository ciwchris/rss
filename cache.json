          "description": "There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.\n¬†\n\nBased on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.\n¬†\nLab1:\ncode:\nsync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.\n\nLab2:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n¬†\nLab3:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\nLab4:\ncode:\nasync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n¬†\nConclusion:\n1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing¬†FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and¬†PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency.¬†\n2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.\n¬†\nReference link:\nAzure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings | Microsoft Learn\nImprove throughput performance of Python apps in Azure Functions | Microsoft Learn",
