Writing about an operating business is a different thing that writing feature announcements or essays about technology: the ramifications of honesty, spin, or disclosure are so much more vast and unpredictable. This is why we often learn about people’s trials or a company’s struggles only years later, but at the time everyone exudes confidence.\nBut, having drafted something about this a few times and edited myself into knots, I figure it’s better to just write something. The best writing always comes after I’ve scrapped a draft anyway.\nThe company behind Placemark, Working Idea LLC, is still a bootstrapped, single-person enti…",

Val.town is a system for programming in the small, for writing short programs in TypeScript that can link together into something larger. It’s for writing that scheduled web scraper or basic API that you wanted to make but didn’t want to add to your pile of servers on AWS or GCP. It’s already a lot of fun to use, and is going to keep getting better.\n\nPlacemark lives. It’s still getting better every week. It’s been about two years since I formally started it, and it’s grown into a great product with the help of supportive and creative customers. I’ve been relatively quiet about Placemark-the-business, despite writing a steady flow of blog posts on features & improvements on placemark.io. But, soon - I’ll publish a state of Placemark in the near future.\nI’m tremendously excited about Val.town. It’s a small team in Brooklyn and Seattle, with lots of creative energy. I think we’ll be able to take this opportunity and make something great, something that in retrospect always should have existed.",
