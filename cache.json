Even though the new texlive-basic replaces the old texlive-core, many of the texlive-core contents (including language specific files) are now split between different packages. To find out which Arch package contains a specific CTAN package, you can use the tlmgr utility, eg.\n$ tlmgr info euler | grep collection\ncollection:  collection-latexrecommended\n\nwhich means the euler CTAN package is contained in texlive-latexrecommended. You may also use pacman -F to query for specific files.\nA new metapackage texlive-meta is available to install all subpackages (except for language specific ones), and the new texlive-doc package provides the full documentation for offline use.",

Databases are responsible for storing and managing vast amounts of data, providing real-time access to information, and powering critical business operations. As the amount of data and the number of users accessing databases continues to grow, it is essential to ensure that they can handle the expected workload and perform efficiently under heavy traffic. Whether you are launching a new application or getting ready for peak traffic, load testing helps you ensure that your database can handle the load and deliver reliable performance.\n \nWhile most database queries typically happen through an application endpoint, there are situations where it is beneficial to directly test the database w…",
