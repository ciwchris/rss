By default, the front-end’s OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.\nApp Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

          "description": "There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.\n \n\nBased on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.\n \nLab1:\ncode:\nsync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.\n\nLab2:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n \nLab3:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\nLab4:\ncode:\nasync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n \nConclusion:\n1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency. \n2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.\n \nReference link:\nAzure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings | Microsoft Learn\nImprove throughput performance of Python apps in Azure Functions | Microsoft Learn",
