After analyzing customer research and telemetry, version 1.28.0 will include new updates/features that will benefit our developers’ journey.\n \nTo highlight a few features, the Storage Explorer 1.28.0 now allows for Text preview enhancements and downloading multiple blobs at once when filtering based on a tag:\n \n\n \n \n\nText Preview Enhancements\n\nAdditional content-types have been added to the built in list of content-types which can be text previewed. These include: - text/xml - application/xml - application/json\nYou can now preview files of any size, but only the first 10MB of the file. You can download the file and open it in your default text editor to view the entire file. A status bar will appear at the top of the preview tab that informs you of files greater than 10MB\n\n\nMulti Blob Download When Filtering by Tags\n\nWhen filtering by tags, you can now download multiple blobs at once by clicking the Download in either the context menu or toolbar of the blob\n\n\n\n \nOther features in this update include:\n\nSAS Expiration Warnings\nTrust File Extension During Open\nCopy Between Blob Containers and File Shares\nFilter by Prefix in ADLS Gen2 Blob Containers\nSub-Directory Prefix Search in File Shares\nCopy Tables with Azure AD Credentials\nPreserving of Blob Tags During Clone\nLease Operations on ADLS Gen2 Folders\nADLS Gen2 Soft Delete Feature Flag Removed",

We understand that the static web app must do something to block the request. We can try to unlink the function app from static web app. However, you will find the function app still encounters the same error. How can we make our function app back to normal?\n \n\n \nIf you read the official document (Bring your own functions to Azure Static Web Apps | Microsoft Learn) carefully, you will find following statement.\n \nIf authentication and authorization policies aren't already set up on your existing Functions app, then the static web app has exclusive access to the API. To make your Functions app accessible to other applications, add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.\n \nIt seems that the link operation will add authentication limitation to only allow static webapp to access the function app. If you navigate to the authentication setting of the function app, you will find the static webapp was added as an identity provider. Even we unlink the function app to static webapp, the identity provider will not be removed automatically. We need to remove the identity provider manually.
