People whose genetic profile makes them more likely to be 'early birds' can adjust to the time change in a few days. But those who tend to be 'night owls' could take more than a week to get back on track.",

By combining fMRI and EEG, they provide unprecedented evidence that the work of sorting out the thousands of pieces of information processed during the day takes place during deep sleep. Indeed, the brain can evaluate all of these memories in order to retain only the most useful ones.",
