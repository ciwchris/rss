However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.\nApp Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

          "description": "There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.\n \n\nBased on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.\n \nLab1:\ncode:\nsync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.\n\nLab2:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n \nLab3:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\nLab4:\ncode:\nasync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n \nConclusion:\n1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency. \n2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.\n \nReference link:\nAzure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings | Microsoft Learn\nImprove throughput performance of Python apps in Azure Functions | Microsoft Learn",

          "description": "As a PHP developer, sometimes you might want to set the custom configuration file (.ini) to read when PHP starts up. For this article, I would like demonstrate how to load custom configuration file (.ini) in the Azure App Service.\n \nBy default, we set the PHP_INI_DIR = /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, so when using SSH on Kudu, you could see there are lots of .ini files:\n\n \nBased on this, you might think we could just manually add our custom .ini files in /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, but it will not work after restart. Since only \"/home\" data will be persistent after restarting App Service. So what we need to do is to add our .ini in \"/home\", E.g. \"/home/site/ini\"\n \nFor example, if I would like to modify \"upload_max_filesize to 64M (defualt is 2M) and post_max_size to 64M (default is 8M)\" for the PHP website, I could follow the below steps to achieve it:\n \nStep 1:\nUse like vi/vim command to add setting.ini file in the \"/home/site/ini\" folder\n\n \nStep 2:\nPHP supports scanning multiple directories for .ini files. For this we need to set PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with \":\" to separate values on the Application Setting for the target App Service.\nE.g. PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR = :/home/site/ini\nThis ensures that we load *.ini files from  /usr/local/etc/php and then load from /home/site/ini\n\n \n \nAfter, we check the value by simple php page and it will show upload_max_size and post_max_size are set as 64M now.\n\n \nReference:\n\nUnderstanding the Azure App Service file system: Understanding the Azure App Service file system · projectkudu/kudu Wiki · GitHub\nConfigure a PHP app for Azure App Service: Configure PHP apps - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn",

          "description": "Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.\n \nHere are the steps to create a preview environment:\n \n1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it \"dev\".\n\n\n \n2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include \"dev\" in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.\n\n \n3. Set \"production_branch\" to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.\n\n \n4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named 'dev' for the dev branch.\n\n \n5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the \"deployment_environment\" to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.\n\n \n\n \nThe main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named. \n \nOverall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.

          "description": "Encrypting data at rest is a primary step in securing a Kubernetes cluster. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.\nFor clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.",
