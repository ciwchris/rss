They teased a dashcam hardware in 2020, and announced the crypto angle in 2022.\nThe idea of individuals contributing streetview-like imagery with a dashcam is not new. Mapillary did exactly that starting in 2013, established a large dataset and active community in a few years, and sold to Facebook in 2020.\nWhat follows is a quick review of what is currently available about Hivemapper’s new phase:\nWhat is a “map” in this case?\nA map is streetview-like imagery. The type and breadth of data collected is really similar to what Mapillary collected: you’re getting front-facing camera imagery with GPS. Sure, you can collect a f…",

In honor of growing older, this is sort of a super-cut of a bunch of different drafts that I previously judged to be too odd or personal.\nConstants\nThe idea has been rephrased a million times in different medias, but I like DFW’s framing of “whatever you worship will eat you alive”. A decade ago, I honestly believed I’d learn a few things, achieve what I wanted, and settle into a sort of non-striving creative flow for the rest of my days.

The research team leveraged electronic dental and health records of 10,000+ patients to gain a better understanding of how oral health treatments affect individuals' overall health over time. The study found that people with dentures had a significant decline in nutrition markers. People who did not wear dentures did not experience this decline. This is believed to be the first study to report results of utilizing lab values of nutritional biomarkers and linking them with dental records.",

The experiment was designed to test resistance to the phenomenon known as 'incubation of craving,' meaning the longer a desired substance is denied, the harder it is to ignore signals for it. The findings suggest that exercise modulated how hard the rats were willing to work for cues associated with the pellets, reflecting how much they craved them.",

During this time, the mother's body undergoes a series of physiological and behavioral changes to create a favorable environment for the embryo's development. However, the frequent consumption of tasty and high calorie foods -- derived from the cravings -- contributes to weight gain and obesity in pregnancy, which can have negative effects on the baby's health.",

At the same time, for decades, people who have survived an encounter with death have recalled unexplained lucid episodes involving heightened consciousness and awareness. These have been reported using the popular -- yet scientifically ill-defined -- term 'near-death experiences'.",

Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.\n \nBefore talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss \"what is web.xml\"?\n \nJava web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.\n \nThe default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.\n \nWhen tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. \n \nIt instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.\nThere you specify:\n\nwhat servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to\nlisteners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)\nconfiguration parameters (context-params)\nerror pages, welcome files\nsecurity constraints\n\nBack to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:\n\n \nTo add a custom error page, please follow below steps:\n\nAdd <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page \"error.html\" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use \"/error.html\" in <location></location>.\n\n\n\nAdd your custom error in webapps folder.\n\n\n\nBuild and re-deploy the project to App Service.\nNow you will see the custom error page replace the default one.\n\n\n \nPlease kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site.
