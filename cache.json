I’ve been spending far too much time building a startup, reading about startups, being in the loop. My friends will tell me about an eight million dollar funding round and I’ll say “oh, that little, for a 2022 Series A?” I need perspective, a break, a breath of fresh air.\nThe thing about IndieWeb is that it’s still a place where people and ideas matter. You can have a whole conversation without mentioning money or a business plan. IndieWeb is about owning your own small parcel of internet-land and farming it with your own hands. Much like sharecropping, it isn’t ethically pure. But it’s a heck of a lot nicer than than the world built on value extraction and exclusion.\nEnough introspection…",

Like a surfer that avoids smooth water and favors more active waves, the brain uses faster, choppier waves to process information to which it is paying attention. By separating how the brain encodes its state of attention versus stimuli to which it is responding, scientists hope to understand sleep, anesthesia, attention, and disease better.",

ALS and FTD are two neurodegenerative disorders in which many cases are linked by mislocalization of TDP-43, where instead of being primarily located in the nucleus of the cell where genes are activated, it forms aggregates outside the nucleus in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Rare mutations in the TDP-43 gene are known to cause ALS, but almost all cases of ALS show mislocalization of TDP-43.",

Researchers argue that the negative health effects of obesity stem not simply from an excess of fat but from the decline in its ability to respond to changes, or in other words, its plasticity.",
