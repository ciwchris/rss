This process brings simplicity, consistency, and a better mechanism to govern IT policies when deploying Java apps to the cloud. We’re now enhancing the build process with two new features: Tomcat and build environment variable support.\n \nTomcat is one of the most popular and widely used Java web servers, providing a fast and reliable platform for running Java applications on the web. By supporting Tomcat in the cloud build process, we make it easy for developers to migrate their existing Java web applications to Azure Container Apps without changing any code or configuration.\n \nBuild environment variables are variables that affect how the build process is executed.
