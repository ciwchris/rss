Placemark supports a lot of file formats - not all, but a good handful of the vector data formats for geospatial data.\nI recently added support for FlatGeobuf, a really neat format that can store basically the same stuff as GeoJSON, but it produces much smaller files, includes a tree index so that you can search for geospatial data within a buffer, and supports random access by storing offsets to data in the file.

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.",

Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C.
