It was a busy work\nmonth on Placemark, busy warm weekends in Brooklyn, then a lovely trip\nto Konstanz, Paris, and Switzerland.\n\nReading\nI finally got my momentum back with reading, thanks in part to\nthose transatlatic flights and smooth European train trips.\nYou’re Paid What You’re Worth\nwas eye-opening: it digs into all of the generalizations about\nwages both left and right and unpacks the complicated truth\nusing data and just enough narrative. Stories of Your Life And\nOthers\nwas another gem of creativity from Chiang. His stories each feel like a puzzle\nor a math thesis, proving out some fascinating version of a possible\nworld. They’re a lot of fun.\nI didn’t find much internet writing that inspired me this month.\nMaybe it’s because all of…",

Now scientists have shown that the same may be true for cells, uncovering a newly-discovered mechanism that might help prevent the build-up of tangles of proteins commonly seen in dementia. Scientists have identified a new mechanism that appears to reverse the build-up of aggregates, not by eliminating them completely, but rather by 'refolding' them.",

However, scientists have provided evidence, from research in mice, that transplanting fecal microbiota from young into old mice can reverse hallmarks of aging in the gut, eyes, and brain. In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.",

While there are a certain class of problems which support you starting from scratch, it's not uncommon to have an existing API that you're bound to, and in that case, GraphQL might not be as easy to tackle.\nHere's a scenario that I want to put forth, you've got an existing API, maybe it's REST, maybe it's a bespoke HTTP API, none the less you're building a new client in which you want to consume the endpoint as GraphQL. We could go down the path of creating an Apollo Server and using the RESTDataSource, or using HotChocolate's REST support, but for both of these…",
