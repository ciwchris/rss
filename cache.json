In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.",

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.",

Three slices of bread or one teaspoon of table salt will do it, and chances are your daily sodium intake is far greater. More than 90% of Americans consume too much sodium, which can lead to hypertension, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. A new article provides a comprehensive review of scientific literature on sodium reduction strategies in food production.",

          "description": "In a function app, usually we use appsetting AzureWebJobsStorage to connect to storage. This blog shows you how to configure a function app using Azure Active Directory identities instead of secrets or connection strings, where possible. Using identities helps you avoid accidentally leaking sensitive secrets and can provide better visibility into how data is accessed.\n \nThis will not work if the storage account is in a sovereign cloud or has a custom DNS.\n \nBelow are the steps to do configuration.\n \n1. Enable system assigned identity in your function app and save it.\n\n \n2. Give storage access to your function app. Search for Storage Blob Data Owner, select it.\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n3. If you configure a blob-triggered function app, repeat the step 2 to add Storage Account Contributor and Storage Queue Data Contributor roles which will be used for blob trigger.\n\n \n\n \n \n4. Return to Access Control (IAM), click Role assignments, search for your function app name to confirm the roles are added successfully.\n\n \n \n5. Navigate to your function app. Select Configuration and edit AzureWebJobsStorage. Change the name to AzureWebJobsStorage__accountname.  Change the value to your storage account name. (The new setting uses a double underscore (__), which is a special character in application settings.) \n\n \n \n6. Delete the previous AzureWebJobsStorage. Then you will find your function app still works fine.",

          "description": "Growing adoption of containers for workload deployments has seen the emergence of Kubernetes as the preferred container orchestrator tool in the Cloud Native ecosystem. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the managed Kubernetes offering from Azure, allows customers to offload the operational overhead to Azure, thus letting the user focus primarily on their workloads and business logic. However, as users migrate large scale workloads to containers, they often create a large number of AKS clusters for various reasons – clusters in different environments (QA/test, staging, prod), clusters in different regions for high availability or localization/proximity, or using clusters to achieve strong isolation between workloads. But the large number of clusters may result in platform admins having to dea…",

To support this, we have increased the number of nodes you can have in a single Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from 1,000 to 5,000.  This will allow you to reduce the number of clusters needed to run your workloads, reducing the operational overhead needed to support application teams.\n \nWhen using the uptime SLA you can request a quota increase across all node pools in the cluster by raising a support request.  \n \nNetworking at scale\n \nOne of the things we hear a lot from our customers is around IP address exhaustion.  The release of Dynamic IP allocation has helped to reduce the need to pre-allocate IP…",

          "description": "Azure Static Web Apps automatically builds and deploys dozens of frontend frameworks, one of them is Nuxt. Today, we're excited to share that you can deploy Nuxt 3 applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps.\n \nWhile Nuxt 2 is known for its ease of use, Nuxt 3 brings even faster performance and improved developer experience with a thrilling new set of underlying technologies and features. With the release of Nuxt 3’s release candidate in April 2022, developers witnessed a complete re-architect of the framework. Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge also work with Azure Static Web Apps.\n \nWhat’s new in Nuxt 3? \n \n\nZero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps \nAPI routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories \nVue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability \nNitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static \nVite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production \n\nUniversal rendering vs static rendering\n \nPreviously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.\n \nWith Nuxt 3's support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering. \n \nTo learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.\n \nNuxt 3 Sample App on Azure Static Web Apps\n \nNuzhat Minhaz is a Program Manager Intern on the Azure Static Web App team at Microsoft.
