          "description": "When we smell food, we are more likely to eat -- but new findings suggest eating food also impacts our sense of smell, which could bias what we eat next. Imaging shows that brain's response to odors similar to a recent meal is less 'food-like' than its response to a different food odor. Interplay between smell and food intake may have evolutionary benefit in helping humans diversify diet",

          "description": "Researchers have found that blood flow in the brain capillaries, which is important for oxygen/nutrient delivery and waste removal, was increased during rapid eye movement sleep in mice. Adenosine A2a receptors might be at least partially responsible for this increased blood flow. These findings bring new hope for understanding the function of sleep and developing treatments for neurodegenerative diseases that involve the buildup of waste products in the brain, such as Alzheimer's disease.",

These guidelines focus on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), which affects the arteries. As the inside of the arteries become clogged up by fatty deposits, they can no longer supply enough blood to the body. This process is the main cause of heart attacks, strokes, PAD and sudden death where arteries become completely blocked. The most important way to prevent these conditions is to adopt a healthy lifestyle throughout life, especially not smoking, and to treat risk factors.",
