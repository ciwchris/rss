If a YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR higher (or lower) than the default (5) is needed, it can be set using the rounds option of the pam_unix [8] module (i.e. in /etc/pam.d/system-auth).\nGeneral list of changes\nyescrypt is used as default password hashing algorithm, instead of SHA512\npam honors the chosen ENCRYPT_METHOD in /etc/login.defs and does not override the chosen method anymore\nchanges in the filesystem (>= 2023.09.18) and pambase (>= 20230918) packages ensure, that umask is set centrally in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile\n[1] https://www.openwall.com/yescrypt/\n[2] https://man.archlinux.org/man/umask.1p\n[3] https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PAM\n[4] https://www.password-hashing.net/\n[5] https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt/pull/113\n[6] https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt/pull/150\n[7] https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/issues/607\n[8] https://man.archlinux.org/man/pam_unix.8",

          "description": "In some scenarios, you might need to preprocess files before they're used by your application. For instance, you're deploying a¬†machine learning¬†model that relies on precomputed data files. An Init Container can download, extract, or preprocess these files, ensuring they are ready for the main application container. This approach simplifies the deployment process and ensures that your application always has access to the required data.\n¬†\nThe below example defines a simple Pod that has an init container which downloads a file from some resource to a file share which is shared between the init and main app container. The main app container is running a php-apache image and serves the landing page using the index.php file downloaded into the shared file space.\n¬†\n\n¬†\nThe init container mounts the shared volume at¬†/mydir , and the main application container mounts the shared volume at¬†/var/www/html. The init container runs the following command to download the file and then terminates: wget -O /mydir/index.php¬†http://info.cern.ch.¬†\n¬†\nConfigurations and dockerfile for init container:\n¬†\n\nMount the storage file share on the environment level\nCreate init container with mounting file share named init on path /mydir:\n\n\n¬†\n¬†\n\nDockerfile¬†for init which downloads an index.php file under /mydir:\n\n¬†\nFROM busybox:1.28 \nWORKDIR / \nENTRYPOINT [\"wget\", \"-O\", \"/mydir/index.php\", \"http://info.cern.ch\"]\n¬†\n¬†\n¬†\nConfiguration for main app container:\n¬†\n\nCreate main app container mounting file share named init on path /var/www/html:\n\n\n¬†\n¬†\n\nMain app container configuration which uses php-apache image and serves the index.php file from DocumentRoot /var/www/html:\n\n\n¬†\nOutput:\n¬†\n\n¬†\n¬†\n¬†\nLogs:",
