          "description": "The last time I wrote a “year in review” post was 2017, and before that in 2012. Reading my old writing is nostalgic and horrific.\n\n\nBy the numbers, 2023 was pretty normal: I read around 20 books, ran around 400 miles. It’s funny how the statistics even out to the same numbers when, during the year, I think I’m in a reading drought or, like several months this year, hadn’t run in weeks.\nWhat was the best?\n\nI think that the best book in general that I read was Achieving Our Country by Richard Rorty. I think I’ve been politically shifting for a while now – not to the left or the right, but around questions of reform versus radicalism, unification versus schism. Rorty isn’t the last word on the matter, but reading him was inspiring because it opened my eyes to the other possibilities of how t…",

The desire to own ones own home is\nalmost universal in the people I know in the US. It’s even stronger for folks\nwho live outside of major cities. And people for whom the “security” part of\nhomeownership rings stronger - who grew up in instability or in countries where\nphysical goods are preferred to financial instruments for savings.\nI don’t want to buy a house. Maybe I’ll need to, but I can’t help but think that\nthe milestone is vastly overrated in public imagination and there are problems\nwith it on a personal and societal level.\nEconomics\nHouses are non-diversified, illiquid holdings that make up too large a\npercentage of people’s total invested assets.\nYour neighbor…",
