You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.\nResponse time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining …",

We have released a TestFlight version of the new version that should work. We are planning to release it to app store as soon as we get positive verification from users.
