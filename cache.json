Now, researchers have identified specific peptides in CTH that might someday be used in new, natural sleep remedies.",

It is often assumed that feeling more negative will color people's experience of emotional images and events in the environment around them. However, researchers found that while going 24 hours without sleep impacted study participants' mood, it did not change their performance on tests evaluating their ability to process emotional words and images.",
