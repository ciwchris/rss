          "description": "Six years later, I’m still taking a lot of notes in notebooks. I’ve bought many editions of Field Notes, which I still love. And emptied many Muji pens on the page.\nBut I have to admit: I’ve only reopened my archived notebooks a handful of times. Once or twice to retrieve contemporaneous notes about business events, and a few times to refresh my memory of the early part of a book while writing a review. So what are notes for?\nPart of the Field Notes motto is “I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now.” That captures part of it, but memory isn’t the only lens to think about note-taking.\nA common thread here is semblance. Note-taking is about building a semblance of understanding, in the same way that exercise can be about creating a semblance of control.\n\nI’ve dissed “knowledge graphs” ad-nauseum – that by virtue of never labeling the edges they never capture real relationship between items and make vague thinking easy, that none of their implementers roll up their sleeves and implement better graph layout so they’re readable and instead use d3’s force directed graph or graphviz, that they just never really become useful.\nBut whatever: is it really about using the graph, or is it about looking at it?\nYou can feel like you understand something without knowing anything about it, and you can understand something without feeling like you do. Both are problematic. Creating notes and other symbols of knowledge is a way to affect that balance.\nMaybe the real metacognition isn’t about having a mirror image of your brain encoded in a computer, but just having a mirror. Having a nice birch box filled with notebooks or a nice dense graph that symbolizes all the things you’ve noted, so that you can learn and forget comfortably. The world will always be too big to understand, but my box of notebooks, that I know.",

          "description": "I wrote a little yearly round-up over on Placemark.\nI’m not one for concrete resolutions or nostalgia, so on with the usual, a Recently.\nReading\nI read Policing the Open Road\non Rebecca’s suggestion. It’s an incredible book that I’ll\nprobably re-read soon, because the central conflict that it sets out feels so thoroughly\ndeadlocked, unresolvable, and important - the interplay between privacy, safety, police\npower, and freedom.\nI don’t agree with all of it, but Jon McLoone’s explanatio of why Wolfram is not open source\nresonated strongly with me. Placemark, as I’ve said before, is not planning on being\nopen source, though components of the application will be released. Some of my reasoning\nlines up with Wolfram’s pretty precisely. The central piece for me, I think, is just\nwhat the community means - where communities come from, how they agree on what they\ndo, how they collect and disperse. Magical thinking around what constitutes\ncommunity and how it operates is my biggest gripe about open source ideology in this\nday and age: too many people happily ignore the top-heaviness of some communities,\nor don’t think about where the direction, leadership, contributions, and standards\ncome from.\nWatching\n\nWatch Vampire’s Kiss. That is all.\nExpect to see in the new year: more, probably shorter, blog posts. More photos.\nAnd Placemark, out in the wild.",

          "description": "The huge success of Docker in energizing the tech community around containers has been truly amazing to see.  As containers are the foundation of Kubernetes, it goes hand in hand that Docker was a core part of the platform. As Kubernetes matured, and the needs of the community and our customers grew, the tight coupling of Docker to Kubernetes through dockershim (the interface between the Kubernetes platform and the Docker runtime) needed to evolve. On 2 December 2020, with the release of Kubernetes 1.20, Kubernetes announced it is deprecating Docker as a container runtime, through the use of dockershim, in a future release of Kubernetes.\n \nWith the upcoming Kubernetes 1.24 release, dockershim will be removed.\n \nIf you are using a supported Kubernetes version in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):\n\nFor Linux node pools, there is no action required on your part. All supported Kubernetes versions on AKS use containerd as the default runtime for Kubernetes 1.19 and greater.\nFor Windows Server 2019 node pools, in January 2021, we announced the general availability of containerd as the default container runtime for Kubernetes 1.23 and greater. If you are using a cluster with a Kubernetes version prior to 1.23, you can create a new node pool with containerd enabled before the switch over to it being the default in 1.23 then move your pods to the new pool.\n\n \nWe work very closely with the community through our participation in the Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIG) from Storage, to Windows and everything in between and I'd like to thank both the community and our engineering teams for the work to get to this milestone.",

          "description": "by Lucas Santos and Aaron Wislang\n \nIn our previous article we explored how to deploy Grafana and Prometheus on AKS. However, despite Prometheus being an excellent way to monitor your AKS cluster, it lacks some functionality to save metrics for future use and enable us to query historical data.\n \nPrometheus is a metrics collector, it can be used to collect metrics from any source, and it can be used to generate graphs. However, it is not a data storage solution and therefore isn't not focused on storing data for historical purposes. Prometheus has its storage solution and supports both on-disk storage as well as remote locations. You can configure a lot of options but the data management options are limited. This is where Thanos can help.\n \nThere is also a configuration overhead when we wa…",

You can seamlessly ship Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud logs and metrics into Elastic, instrument Spring Boot apps, and monitor every step of your cloud journey. And gain a holistic view across Spring Boot applications and other logs and metrics in your cloud and on-premises environments.\n \nOver the past two years, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about the scenarios they face. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to aggregate logs and metrics from these applications and instrument them for application performance m…",

          "description": "We are happy to announce the availability of the initial public preview of the App Service Environment (ASE) v3 migration tool. With this feature, you'll be able to migrate your existing ASE as well as the apps running on that ASE to ASEv3. ASEv3 provides a number of feature differences as well as performance enhancements and potential reduced overall costs compared to previous versions. To get a complete overview on ASEv3, read the ASEv3 focused App Service Environment overview.\n\nCheck out the following docs to learn more about migrating to ASEv3:\n\n- Migrate to App Service Environment v3\n- How to Migrate to ASEv3\n\nPlease note, at this time, the public preview supports a subset of possible ASE configurations. Be sure to review the supported scenarios to see if you can migrate at this time using the feature and stay tuned for updates as we release additional capabilities.\n\nAn Azure portal experience for migration will be available at the start of February, 2022. Be on the lookout for additional announcements.\n\nIf your ASE isn't supported for migration using the migration feature and your ASE isn't listed under one of the upcoming supported scenarios, you have the option to migrate to ASEv3 manually. See the migration alternatives for more details.",
