For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked Task #56716) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.\nPackaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the \"Add a new Bug\" button on the package page on archlinux.org will automatically direct you to the correct place to open the issue. The workflow afterwards is mostly the same, first our Bug Wranglers will have a look at the issues and triage them, and then they will be handed over to the respective Package Maintainers to fix. A list of all issues can be found here.\nIf you do not have an account for GitLab already (which authenticates against our SSO service), please write us a mail with your desired username to accountsupport@archlinux.org as advised in the banner.",

Building it was incredibly fun.\nFailing to find success and sustainability was pretty hard but it’s okay.\nHere’s the plan:\nToday I’m turning off signups to Placemark.io.\nPlacemark is free for all existing customers until January 19, 2023,\nat which point the servers will be shut down.\nLater in January, I’ll release the full source code to the site. This might\ntake a little while. It’s a big application.\nBuilding Placemark was an incredible experience. I learned a ton and got to\nknow a lot of new people in the process. I’m really proud of what it turned\nout to be, even if the business fell short of my goals.\nI built, coded, designed, documented, marketed, and ran Placemark. It had paying\ncustomers who used it for real-world purposes. It shipped, and it was a real business.\nWith luck, it’ll become something as an open source project – either maintained,\nor used as inspiration and fuel for future projects. I’m happy to create more\nvalue than I capture.\nThere’s more to write about what I learned, but for now I just want to say\nthanks to everyone who gave it a shot, and all of the people who were\nsupportive along the way - special thanks to\nGabriel Coch, Aaron Boodman,\nBrian Lovin, Adam Krebs,\nPrerna Nadathur, and many others.",
