It was great, and gets me off\non a good footing for reading a lot more fiction in 2023.\nI really liked Brian Potter’s weekend roundup,\nwhich covers a lot of funky building technology –\nwooden potash storage, robotically-assembled buildings, 3D\nprinted houses.\nI have mixed feelings about the layoffs explainer from prof\nPfeffer\nthat has made the rounds a few times.

          "description": "Yesterday, I announced that I was joining Val.town, but that Placemark lived. And I haven’t really given an update on Placemark, the product and business, in a while. Writing about an operating business is a different thing that writing feature announcements or essays about technology: the ramifications of honesty, spin, or disclosure are so much more vast and unpredictable. This is why we often learn about people’s trials or a company’s struggles only years later, but at the time everyone exudes confidence.\nBut, having drafted something about this a few times and edited myself into knots, I figure it’s better to just write something. The best writing always comes after I’ve scrapped a draft anyway.\nThe company behind Placemark, Working Idea LLC, is still a bootstrapped, single-person enti…",

          "description": "Last week I joined val.town as Steve Krouse’s cofounder. Val.town is a system for programming in the small, for writing short programs in TypeScript that can link together into something larger. It’s for writing that scheduled web scraper or basic API that you wanted to make but didn’t want to add to your pile of servers on AWS or GCP. It’s already a lot of fun to use, and is going to keep getting better.\n\nPlacemark lives. It’s still getting better every week. It’s been about two years since I formally started it, and it’s grown into a great product with the help of supportive and creative customers. I’ve been relatively quiet about Placemark-the-business, despite writing a steady flow of blog posts on features & improvements on placemark.io. But, soon - I’ll publish a state of Placemark in the near future.\nI’m tremendously excited about Val.town. It’s a small team in Brooklyn and Seattle, with lots of creative energy. I think we’ll be able to take this opportunity and make something great, something that in retrospect always should have existed.",

Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.\n \n\n \nThe collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:\n\nConfiguring data sources\nJava Key Store usage for certificates\nUsing Maven to deploy to App Service\nProper use of the file system in Azure\nUsing Azure Service Bus for JMS\nUsing Azure Active Directory as an identity provider\n… and more!\n\n \nCheck out this Video Demo for more information.\n \nYou can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat’s website or install it as a VS Code plugin.\n \nHave questions or comments?
