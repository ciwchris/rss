          "description": "The last thirteen days, after I opened the doors and let Placemark into the world, have been a blur. Mostly the good kind!\nIt came down to a question of whether the things I thought should be priorities were actually the priorities. I had a backlog that could easily have stretched a few more weeks into the future, and by the time I was done with those tasks I probably would have found some more that seemed like a priority. But there’s a real danger of going too far down the wrong road with these things.\nWhat I learned was a great mix of confirmations - that what I’m building is useful - and surprises, about what’s important and what troubles people run into. Reacting and improving in response to those has been exciting. For quite a few emails, I was able to ship the feature or the fix befo…",

They teased a dashcam hardware in 2020, and announced the crypto angle in 2022.\nThe idea of individuals contributing streetview-like imagery with a dashcam is not new. Mapillary did exactly that starting in 2013, established a large dataset and active community in a few years, and sold to Facebook in 2020.\nWhat follows is a quick review of what is currently available about Hivemapper’s new phase:\nWhat is a “map” in this case?\nA map is streetview-like imagery.

In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.",

Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.",

This technique has allowed researchers to rewind the cellular biological clock by around 30 years according to molecular measures, significantly longer than previous reprogramming methods. The partially rejuvenated cells showed signs of behaving more like youthful cells in experiments simulating a skin wound. This research, although in early stages, could eventually have implications for regenerative medicine, especially if it can be replicated in other cell types.",

The charts are the result of a research project spanning six continents and bringing together possibly the largest ever MRI datasets ever aggregated -- almost 125,000 brain scans from over a 100 different studies. Although not currently intended for clinical use, the team hopes the charts will become a routine clinical tool similar to how standardised paediatric growth charts are used.",

The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population's increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.",

The experiment was designed to test resistance to the phenomenon known as 'incubation of craving,' meaning the longer a desired substance is denied, the harder it is to ignore signals for it. The findings suggest that exercise modulated how hard the rats were willing to work for cues associated with the pellets, reflecting how much they craved them.",

          "description": "App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.\n \nBefore talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss \"what is web.xml\"?\n \nJava web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.\n \nThe default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.\n \nWhen tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. \n \nIt instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.\nThere you specify:\n\nwhat servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to\nlisteners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)\nconfiguration parameters (context-params)\nerror pages, welcome files\nsecurity constraints\n\nBack to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:\n\n \nTo add a custom error page, please follow below steps:\n\nAdd <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page \"error.html\" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use \"/error.html\" in <location></location>.\n\n\n\nAdd your custom error in webapps folder.\n\n\n\nBuild and re-deploy the project to App Service.\nNow you will see the custom error page replace the default one.\n\n\n \nPlease kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.",
