This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won't know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.\n \nIn this post, we'll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We'll create a simple API that implements the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job.

          "description": "What's changing?\nStarting August 1st, Azure Container Registry (ACR) will update its behavior regarding the deletion and re-creation of registries. ACR will prevent the reuse of a subdomain name, e.g. abc123.azurecr.io, for a period after the resource is deleted. This updated behavior enhances security and prevents subdomain takeovers by automatically reserving registry names during the creation of the ACR resource, without requiring any additional action or configuration from customers. \n \nOnce a resource name is reserved, it remains reserved from the moment of creation and throughout an extended period following the deletion of the resource (referred to as a cooldown period). During this cooldown period, subscriptions not associated with the original Azure AD tenant that created the reso…",

So, it was a welcome surprise for me to discover it since I'm way more familiar with Node than Python.\n \nI decided to give the Node SDK a go just to see how well it works and stumbled upon a great cookbook tutorial by OpenAI. I took most of the code from that sample as-is, wrote a static front-end chat client for it, and then wired it up as a sample space called “Activity Planner Agent” that you can easily deploy in App Spaces.  The only prerequisite is that you’ll need an OpenAI API key, which we’ll walk through below.\n \nAnd if you’re interested in seeing the code for the sample space, check …",
