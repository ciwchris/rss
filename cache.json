The IRC network has been used by Arch Linux and many other projects over the past decades as a platform for discussion and support.\nThe dispute led to the exodus of most former freenode staff from the network and the founding of a new network: libera.chat\nStarting today, Arch Linux and its sister projects Arch Linux ARM and Arch Linux 32 will begin migrating the official IRC channels from freenode.net to libera.chat. Please bear with us as this can take some time to be fully settled in.\nWe thank the freenode community for the many years of great service and collaboration.",
