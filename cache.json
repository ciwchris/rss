          "description": "We are excited to announce the launch of two new features in Azure Load Testing: multi-region load tests and support for Locust framework. Azure Load Testing is a fully managed service for performance testing that helps developers and testers easily generate high scale load and identify performance bottlenecks.\n \nWith multi-region load tests, you can now simulate load from multiple geographies simultaneously in a single test run, to closely mimic the real-life traffic patterns. With the in-built dashboard, you get an aggregate view of performance across regions, and you can drill down to a specific region and compare performance metrics across regions. Running multi-region load tests will also help you better validate your network architecture, load balancing components and failover capabi…",

For WordPress developers, it means less manual work: once you push updates, the system automatically tests and deploys them. It's like having a assistant that not only speeds up your work but also checks for errors with each update, ensuring your WordPress site runs smoothly. This constant testing and feedback loop means you can fix bugs quickly and improve your site continuously without disrupting the live version. In short, CI/CD makes your development process faster, more efficient, and less error prone.\n \nHow to get started with Continuous integration and deployment in WordPress on App Service?\n \nNote: This code integration feature is currently enabled with WordP…",

You can now easily monitor your Python apps on App Service without changing your code by leveraging auto-instrumentation that is integrated into the App Services platform.\n \nThis integration supports App Service deploy as code for Python versions 3.11 and lower. Deploy as container scenarios are not currently supported, but we plan to introduce this capability at a future date. We also plan to support Python 3.12 in the near future.\n \nWith this feature enabled, the App Service platform will instrument popular Python libraries in your code and automatically channel correlated application-level logs, metrics, and distributed tracing to your Application Insights resource. This will allow you to understand how your Python application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.\n \nYou can enable the feature at resource creation or from the App Insights blade after your App Service resource is created. Please review our documentation to learn more.\n \nTurn On App Insights during App Service Resource Creation\n \nWhen you create a new Python web application (version 3.11 and lower) using the \"Deploy as code\" option, you can select \"Yes\" on the \"Enable Application Insights\" in the \"Monitoring\" tab. If you select \"Yes\", then your non-containerized Python application will pipe data to an Application Insights resource allowing you to automatically monitor your workloads.\n \n\n \n \nTurn On App Insights after App Service Resource Creation\n \nOpen your App Service application in the portal and go to the App Insights menu item.\n\nSelect \"Enable\" in the toggle under \"Application Insights (Preview)\"\nSelect a location for your Application Insights resource (It’s suggested to create the resource in the same region as the Web App.)",
