          "description": "The php packages have been updated to the latest version 8.2. In\naddition to this, a new set of php-legacy packages have been\nintroduced. These will follow the oldest but still actively supported\nPHP branch. This enables users to install the latest version but also\nintroduces the option to use third party applications that might rely\non an older version. Both branches will be kept up to date following\nour rolling release model. php and php-legacy can be installed at the\nsame time as the latter uses a -legacy suffix for its binaries and\nconfiguration files.\nIn addition to this, the php7 packages have been removed as they\nreached end of life. The imap extension will no longer be provided as\nit relies on the c-client library which has been abandoned for many\nyears.",

Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.\n\n \n2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:\n\n \n3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:\n \n \nmkdir php\ncurl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\\php.zip\ncd php\nunzip php.zip\n \n \n\n\n \n4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is \"*.php\", the Script processor is \"C:\\home\\php\\php-cgi.exe\". Then save it. All the configuration is done.\n\n \n5. To verify it, we can create an \"index.php\" file under C:\\home\\site\\wwwroot with below content.
