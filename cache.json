In short:\nMIT license\nTypeScript codebase\nContributions welcome\nIf you want to learn about the open source codebase, I wrote quite a few blog posts about the architecture that are now archived in the docs repo. The README has been expanded, to some extent, with setup details.\nI’d really love if folks tried out and made use of it. You can really do anything - use it as the foundation for your own application, pull parts into standalone modules, you name it.\n→ Placemark repository\nDetails:\nThe public repository has a flat git history, to maximize security and keep my silly\nprivate commit messages out of the public web. I made 1,439 commits, 406,048++ 218,320–\nthroughout the year. Adam Krebs contributed to\nthe feature table element as well (3 commits, 570++ 279–)\nIt’s complicated. I know it’s a fairly complicated codebase, and also that it is need\nof an update to Next.js. It’s also built on Blitz, which,\nwhile I love it, is getting lapped by tools like tRPC,\nand could be replaced with them.\nI’ll be moving more issues from the private repository to the public one\nover time.\nThe Placemark website is staying online as-is\nfor a little while, until I can archive some pages that are hard to archive. Any advice\nfor how to archive a Webflow site would be much appreciated: their options\nare really limited.\nHave any other questions, or comments? Ask me. The discussions board\nis probably a good place to do that, if you have something private you need to\nask, my email is on this site.\nI’m doing great! Val Town is going really well, and\nI’m excited for Placemark’s new era. Don’t worry about me.",

In this example I have taken a .Net Core Console Application:\n \n \nvar client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri(\"https://<>.azurewebsites.net\") };\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Sending HTTP 2.0 Request.\");\n\n            // HTTP/2 request\n            using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, \"/\") { Version = new Version(2, 0) })\n            using (var response = await client.SendAsync(request))\n                Console.WriteLine(response);\n\n\n \n \nThe HTTPClient class has DefaultRequestVersion property with which you can set the default version of the requests as below:\n \n \nvar SecondRequest = new HttpClient()\n            {\n                BaseAddress = new Uri(\"https://<>.azurewebsites.net\"),\n                DefaultRequestVersion = new Version(2, 0)\n            };\n\n            // HTTP/2 is default\n            using (var response = await SecondRequest.GetAsync(\"/\"))\n                Console.WriteLine(response);\n \n \nYou should be able to see a successful HTTP Response once the code executes:\n \n\n \nFor more information you can refer the below documents:\n\nHttpClient Class (System.Net.Http) | Microsoft Learn\nHttpClient.DefaultRequestVersion Property (System.Net.Http) | Microsoft Learn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you have any other questions, feel free to comment below!",
