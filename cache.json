The last few days have been super, super\nproductive as a result, to the extent that I’ll probably crash\nand take a few days off in a little bit. But for now, I’ve\ngot energy and direction, and I’ve got to ride it.\n\nReading\nThis paper on Ethnographic Research on Dynamicland\nresonated with me. You can read a lot about the technology\nand business of these sorts of efforts, but rarely is there\nsomeone looking for the human interactions, and Dynamicland\nis one of the most unusual and ambitious projects out there.\nBachmann doesn’t editorialize much, but I think some\nthemes emerge, like the tension between “brainstorming”/collaboration versus\nauthority and vision.\nIt reminded me of The Idea Factory,\nthat great book about Bell Labs. Research labs are this odd thing -\npart of what made Bell Labs great was the ability to work on a slightly\nlonger timeline, with fewer limitations on what you created. But\nthat ability was directly a result of the government’s explicit\npermittance of AT&T Bell as a monopoly, during that period of time.\nListening\nTownes Van Zandt by Townes Van Zandt\n\nBeen on a Townes Van Zandt kick recently, sparked of course\nby seeing If I Needed You\npop up in an episode of Patriot.\n\n\nAlmost every time I’m very productive, it coincides with a full listen-through\nof the whole Joanna Newsom ouvre.

          "description": "A new study revealed a pathological brain activity that precedes the onset of Alzheimer's first symptoms by many years: increased activity in the hippocampus during anesthesia and sleep, resulting from failure in the mechanism that stabilizes the neural network. The researchers believe that the discovery of this abnormal activity during specific brain states may enable early diagnosis of Alzheimer's, eventually leading to a more effective treatment of a disease that still lacks effective therapies.",

          "description": "The huge success of Docker in energizing the tech community around containers has been truly amazing to see.  As containers are the foundation of Kubernetes, it goes hand in hand that Docker was a core part of the platform. As Kubernetes matured, and the needs of the community and our customers grew, the tight coupling of Docker to Kubernetes through dockershim (the interface between the Kubernetes platform and the Docker runtime) needed to evolve. On 2 December 2020, with the release of Kubernetes 1.20, Kubernetes announced it is deprecating Docker as a container runtime, through the use of dockershim, in a future release of Kubernetes.\n \nWith the upcoming Kubernetes 1.24 release, dockershim will be removed.\n \nIf you are using a supported Kubernetes version in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):\n\nFor Linux node pools, there is no action required on your part. All supported Kubernetes versions on AKS use containerd as the default runtime for Kubernetes 1.19 and greater.\nFor Windows Server 2019 node pools, in January 2021, we announced the general availability of containerd as the default container runtime for Kubernetes 1.23 and greater. If you are using a cluster with a Kubernetes version prior to 1.23, you can create a new node pool with containerd enabled before the switch over to it being the default in 1.23 then move your pods to the new pool.\n\n \nWe work very closely with the community through our participation in the Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIG) from Storage, to Windows and everything in between and I'd like to thank both the community and our engineering teams for the work to get to this milestone.",

However, it is not a data storage solution and therefore isn't not focused on storing data for historical purposes.

ASEv3 provides a number of feature differences as well as performance enhancements and potential reduced overall costs compared to previous versions. To get a complete overview on ASEv3, read the ASEv3 focused App Service Environment overview.\n\nCheck out the following docs to learn more about migrating to ASEv3:\n\n- Migrate to App Service Environment v3\n- How to Migrate to ASEv3\n\nPlease note, at this time, the public preview supports a subset of possible ASE configurations. Be sure to review the supported scenarios to see if you can migrate at this time using the feature and stay tuned for updates as we release additional capabilities.\n\nAn Azure portal experience for migration will be available at the start of February, 2022. Be on the lookout for additional announcements.\n\nIf your ASE isn't supported for migration using the migration feature and your ASE isn't listed under one of the upcoming supported scenarios, you have the option to migrate to ASEv3 manually.
