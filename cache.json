Azure AD Workload Identity on AKS is now generally available so customers can run production workloads using Workload Identity on both Windows and Linux and migrate applications using Pod Identity over to Workload Identity. \n \nAzure AD Workload Identity leverages Service Account Token Volume Projection giving pods the ability to use a Kubernetes identity (service account), to which a Kubernetes token is issued and OIDC federation which enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory based on annotated service accounts.\n \nSince the open-source pod identity project is now deprecated, AKS will continue to support the AKS pod identity through 2023. To ease the transition, customers can run Pod Identity and Workload Identity in parallel on an existing AKS cluster.  Please note that during the Public Preview we enabled the sidecar to give customers time to update their SDKs, but this is not a supported configuration for General Availability.

However, the module worked fine on my local environment, single virtual machine, or single-instance app service.\n \nThis behavior occurs because Node-Cache and other private cache solutions are designed to store data in the memory of a single process. The private cache works properly when running on a single instance, as all requests are handled by the same process and have access to the same cache.\n \n\nHowever, in a multi-instance environment like a multi-instance App Service, using a private cache can lead to inconsistent behavior and data inconsistency.\n \nFor example, you save a value in one cache in an instance.
