          "description": "A memory dump is a snapshot of the contents of a computer's volatile memory (RAM) stored for analysis or debugging purposes.  ProcDump is a command-line tool designed to monitor applications for CPU/Memory spikes and generate crash dumps when spikes occur. Administrators or developers can then use these dumps to pinpoint the cause of the spikes. This guide will walk you through collecting a memory dump using Procdump.exe for applications hosted on App Service (Windows).\n \n\nAccess the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.\nClick on \"Advanced Tools\" and then \"Go ->\" to access the SCM/Kudu site.\n\n\n \n\nOn the SCM site, go to Process Explorer to find the PID of the w3wp.exe process, which is the application worker process.\n\n\n \n\nUse the Debug console to open the CMD option.\n\n\n \n\nNavigate to the System Drive and access the sysinternals path:\n\nC:\\devtools\\sysinternals>\nNote: The drive letter may vary (e.g., D:\\ or C:)\n\n\n\n \n\nLocate the procdump.exe file in the sysinternals directory, which will be used for running commands.\nTo collect logs for the application worker process, use the PID obtained earlier.\nUse the following command to collect a full memory dump.\n\nProcdump.exe -accepteula -ma [PID] [Path]\n\nPath: Specifies the directory where the collected memory dump file will be stored.\n\n\nExample: procdump.exe -accepteula -ma 5100 C:\\dumps\\\n\n\n\n \n\nInitiate the dump collection and reproduce the issue the application is facing.\n\n\n \n\nAfter the memory dump collection is complete, access the specific path on the SCM site to download the collected memory dump.\n\n\n\n \nYou can consult the following article for further details on Procdump commands and various parameters to utilize depending on your specific needs and troubleshooting scenario.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump\n \nIt's advisable to gather multiple sets of memory dumps because analyzing several dumps can reveal patterns and facilitate the development of an action plan to resolve issues effectively.",

Refer to the browser network traces provided below.\n\n\n \n\nAnalyze the profiler traces to pinpoint the cause of the reported delay.\n\n\n \n\nAfter examining the demo app's code, it was evident that a deliberate 20-second delay was introduced in the Privacy method within the Home Controller.\n\n\n \n\nNote: Default profiler log collection time is 60 seconds and it is possible to increase the default profiling duration by setting an application setting IIS_PROFILING_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS with a maximum value of 900 (i.e. 15 minutes).",
