I even had a shirt with the copyleft logo on it.\nThe idea of freely sharing creative works, to be recombined by a community, was exhilarating: I would contribute raw materials to the collective - photographs, code, writing - and recombine the works of others, in Photoshop competitions or remixes. Practically every photo I’d license as CC-BY-SA. If someone used one of my photos in their blog, I felt a little jolt of approval and recognition. It felt cool.\nThe same went for open source. The early communities around Drupal and Node.js were radically open source. Companies were releasing their entire products for free and writing detailed blog posts about how they figured out hard problems. Whatever trade secrets they had wer…",

The researchers say that physical activity later in life shifts energy away from processes that can compromise health and toward mechanisms in the body that extend it. They hypothesize that humans evolved to remain physically active as they age -- and in doing so to allocate energy to physiological processes that slow the body's gradual deterioration over the years. This guards against chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even some cancers.",

Kubernetes is highly scalable, highly available, and easy to use, and has many other advantages that make it an excellent choice for building distributed applications.\n \nHowever, its distributed nature means monitoring everything that is happening within the cluster can be a challenge. Prometheus and Grafana make our experience better.\n \nIn this article, we will set up a Kubernetes cluster using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and deploy Prometheus and Grafana to gather monitoring data and visualize them.\n \nUnderstand the tooling\n \nPrometheus is an open source project that was originally created at SoundCloud in 2012, and contributed to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation…",

Here are a few of the incoming features in our 1.18 release: \n \n\nIntelliSense tab completions (i.e. volumes, ports)\n\n\n \n\nTooltips for Compose keywords (i.e. services, image) \n\n\n\nRight-click to format a Compose file (Shift + Alt + F) \nYAML Syntax Validation \nHyperlinks for Docker Images \n\nIn our 1.18 release, this feature will be on by default, so we hope you enjoy it!\n \nThere are more improvements to come! Stay tuned for these features:\n\nMore tab completions\nDocker Compose schema validation \n… and much more! \n\nWe love your feedback! If you have any comments or ideas on our Compose language support, feel free to submit an issue to the Compose Language Service Repo or the VS Code Docker Repo for general feedback.",
