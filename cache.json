We’re really\ntrying not to write a search engine, but it’s tempting, maybe just\nto tinker with Tantivy.\n\nThis is a big year for running, so far.

Felt pretty good!\nMy pacing was good until it wasn’t: need to work on endurance past the eleven\nmile mark.\nI have two 5Ks lined up, but might try running another longer race,\nbecause beating my half marathon PR seems more achievable than\nbeating my 5K PR, whic…",

Quite often, it can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex and dynamic web applications that rely on JavaScript, AJAX, or other browser-side technologies.\nFor testing browser latencies under heavy load, JMeter has a built-in component called Web Driver Sampler, which allows testers to use Selenium WebDriver to simulate real browser actions and interactions with web elements.

However, by default, when running a Java app inside containers, the JVM assumes that the OS memory is shared among multiple applications, so it conservatively claims memory for the Java application.\nWith Azure Container Apps, we can optimize memory allocation by simply dedicating more memory to the Java app, since only one Java application can run inside a container.

Deploy as container scenarios are not currently supported, but we plan to introduce this capability at a future date. We also plan to support Python 3.12 in the near future.\n \nWith this feature enabled, the App Service platform will instrument popular Python libraries in your code and automatically channel correlated application-level logs, metrics, and distributed tracing to your Application Insights resource. This will allow you to understand how your Python application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.\n \nYou can enable the feature at resource creation or from the App Insights blade after your App Service resource is created. Please review our documentation to learn more.\n \nTurn On App Insights during App Service Resource Creation\n \nWhen you create a new Python web application (version 3.11 and lower) using the \"Deploy as code\" option, you can select \"Yes\" on the \"Enable Application Insights\" in the \"Monitoring\" tab. If you select \"Yes\", then your non-containerized Python application will pipe data to an Application Insights resource allowing you to automatically monitor your workloads.\n \n\n \n \nTurn On App Insights after App Service Resource Creation\n \nOpen your App Service application in the portal and go to the App Insights menu item.\n\nSelect \"Enable\" in the toggle under \"Application Insights (Preview)\"\nSelect a location for your Application Insights resource (It’s suggested to create the resource in the same region as the Web App.)",
