For archiving reasons there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked Task #56716) are still stable, migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.\nPackaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging sources, the \"Add a new Bug\" button on the package page on archlinux.org will automatically direct you to the correct place to open the issue. The workflow afterwards is mostly the same, first our Bug Wranglers will have a look at the issues and triage them, and then they will be handed over to the respective Package Maintainers to fix. A list of all issues can be found here.\nIf you do not have an account for GitLab already (which authenticates against our SSO service), please write us a mail with your desired username to accountsupport@archlinux.org as advised in the banner.",

Reading my old writing is nostalgic and horrific.\n\n\nBy the numbers, 2023 was pretty normal: I read around 20 books, ran around 400 miles. It’s funny how the statistics even out to the same numbers when, during the year, I think I’m in a reading drought or, like several months this year, hadn’t run in weeks.\nWhat was the best?\n\nI think that the best book in general that I read was Achieving Our Country by Richard Rorty. I think I’ve been politically shifting for a while now – not to the left or the right, but around questions of reform versus radicalism, unification versus schism. Rorty isn’t the last word on the matter, but reading him was inspiring because it opened my eyes to the other possibilities of how t…",

The desire to own ones own home is\nalmost universal in the people I know in the US. It’s even stronger for folks\nwho live outside of major cities. And people for whom the “security” part of\nhomeownership rings stronger - who grew up in instability or in countries where\nphysical goods are preferred to financial instruments for savings.\nI don’t want to buy a house. Maybe I’ll need to, but I can’t help but think that\nthe milestone is vastly overrated in public imagination and there are problems\nwith it on a personal and societal level.\nEconomics\nHouses are non-diversified, illiquid holdings that make up too large a\npercentage of people’s total invested assets.\nYour neighbor…",

We describe these and the motivation for each in the sections below. \n \nPlease note: \n\nAt this time, DF extension v3.0.0-rc.1 is only supported in the App Service Plan.

Azure Container Apps is a great platform for running polyglot apps and containers of all kinds in Azure, as it abstracts away the complexity of managing underlying Kubernetes while providing unified networking, observability, and scaling for higher developer velocity. While it serves as a versatile container platform, it may not offer precise insights into your Java applications or the state of your Java execution environment (such as the JVM). To better cater to our Java-centric customers running containerized apps, we've recently initiated a new journey to enhance the Java developer experience on Azure Container Apps.\n \n…",
