It’s existed in a de-facto form for\nyears, but only recently earned itself a web standard within the HTML spec.\nThe essence of user activation is that there are certain APIs that do disruptive\nor annoying things like opening pop-up windows or saving a file that shouldn’t be\ncallable arbitrarily. Classically, it’s annoying to open a browser window and\nget a pop-up ad.\nTo crack down on pop-up ads and other annoyances, browsers implemented restrictions\nto these APIs, mostly in the form of tying them to the “click” ev…",

So, take that into\naccount (#ad?), but none of these links are affiliate and my darned honesty\nprevents me from lying for money.\nFor context, webcams are mostly bad. Even companies that make great cameras,\nlike Apple, make terrible webcams. Nobody understands how Apple’s webcams\nare so bad, even in new products.\nThe webcams that Wirecutter recommends are awful.\nYou don’t have to care about webcam quality, because the bar is so low.\nBut I’ve always cared for images and lighting, and I’ve been recording\ndocumentation videos for Placemark\nand attending a steady number of video meetings.

In the reverse experiment, microbes from aged mice induced inflammation in the brain of young recipients and depleted a key protein required for normal vision. These findings show that gut microbes play a role in the regulating some of the detrimental effects of ageing and open up the possibility of gut microbe-based therapies to combat decline in later life.",

The study also determined whether change in risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with blood markers of AD risk, also were affected by sex. Results showed that while care in an Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic setting is equally effective at improving cognitive function in both women and men, the personally-tailored interventions used by the researchers led to greater improvements in women compared to men across AD and CVD disease risk scales, as well blood biomarkers of risk such as blood sugar, LDL cholesterol, and the diabetes test HbA1C. Findings are important because women are disproportionately affected by AD and population-attributable risk models suggest that managing risk factors can prevent up to one-third of dementia cases.",

The study suggests that active brown fat is recruited to counteract 'pre-prediabetic' states, potentially serving as a first-line protective mechanism against very early metabolic or hormonal abnormalities.",

The market-ready meat alternative is very similar in taste and texture, but is a biotech product which -- by replacing beef -- involves much less land resources and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land-use change. This goes under the assumption of a growing world population's increasing appetite for beefy bites, and it is the first time researchers have projected the development of these market-ready meat substitutes into the future, assessing their potential impact on the environment.",
