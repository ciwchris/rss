In the cloud-native era, applications start and stop more frequently, with an increasing need for scale-out to accommodate dynamic traffic demands, making this issue even more prominent. To mitigate this, CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) offers a solution to this challenge by allowing applications to be checkpointed and restored, thus avoiding lengthy startup time after the first initialization.
