I think overall\nI read fewer amazing books than last year, when I finished 20, but also fewer\nduds - though there certainly were some duds. Next year as always, I want to read more\nand I’ll probably dive back into fiction. You can find the whole list and\nreviews in the /reading section. Here are the hits.\nThe Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn by Suleiman Osman\nMy review, on IndieBound\nThis was the best book I read this year. It tells the story of the modern era of Brooklyn - that of real estate appreciation, displacement, redevelopment and preservation, NIMBYs and Robert Moses.

Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.\n\n \n2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:\n\n \n3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:\n \n \nmkdir php\ncurl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\\php.zip\ncd php\nunzip php.zip\n \n \n\n\n \n4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is \"*.php\", the Script processor is \"C:\\home\\php\\php-cgi.exe\". Then save it. All the configuration is done.\n\n \n5. To verify it, we can create an \"index.php\" file under C:\\home\\site\\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:\n \n<?\nphpinfo();\n \n \n\n \nI hope you enjoy it.",

          "description": "The most common way to load test applications is to simulate a specific number of virtual users. But what if you want to test the system to make sure it can handle a desired number of requests per second (RPS) ? For example, you may want to load test a payment gateway service for the number of transactions that can be processed every second. RPS or throughput is a crucial metric that reveals fundamental information about the tested system. Every system has a critical point in terms of throughput. Once the system reaches the critical point, it might keep the throughput around the same level, but the response times go up  or the requests get throttled.\nIn this article you’ll learn how to:\n\nCreate and run a load test for a desired RPS by using Azure Load Testing and the JMeter Throughput Shap…",
