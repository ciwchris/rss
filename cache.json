This information includes, but is not limited to, database credentials, app keys, etc. Traditional MySQL databases use usernames and passwords for login operations, naturally leading to the inclusion of these credentials in project configuration files. Even with proper safeguards, there remain unpredictable risks, such as hacking.\n \nThis tutorial will introduce how to integrate Microsoft Entra with Azure Database for MySQL to avoid using fixed usernames and passwords.

This is a great way to secure your database and ensure that only the right people have access to it.\nNote: For the purpose of this article, I'm going to use Entra ID to refer to a user identity, as well as a managed identity such as a service principal, as the approach is the same in this context here.\nThe above linked documentation covers how you would setup the Azure resource with Entra ID as the authentication mode, so I won't go over that here (also, you can configure that when you initial create the database, or using a Bicep script), instead I want to look at how we use that in a .NET application, because when you're connecting using Entra ID you don't have a pas…",

We have seen that before load testing these endpoints, most users generate an access token and store it in the Azure Key Vault. They then pass this token as a variable in the Header of the request as a bearer token to authenticate at the endpoint. But there might be a few problems with this approach: \n \n\nSometime has elapsed between the act of storing the token in the key vault and the start of execution of the test.
