          "description": "With shadow >= 4.14.0, Arch Linux's default password hashing algorithm changed from SHA512 to yescrypt [1].\nFurthermore, the umask [2] settings are now configured in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile.\nThis should not require any manual intervention.\nReasons for Yescrypt\nThe password-based key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing scheme yescrypt has been chosen due to its adoption (readily available in libxcrypt, which is used by pam [3]) and its stronger resilience towards password cracking attempts over SHA512.\nAlthough the winner of the Password Hashing Competition [4] has been argon2, this even more resilient algorithm is not yet available in libxcrypt [5][6].\nConfiguring yescrypt\nThe YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR setting in /etc/login.defs is currently without effect, until pam implements reading its value [7]. If a YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR higher (or lower) than the default (5) is needed, it can be set using the rounds option of the pam_unix [8] module (i.e. in /etc/pam.d/system-auth).\nGeneral list of changes\nyescrypt is used as default password hashing algorithm, instead of SHA512\npam honors the chosen ENCRYPT_METHOD in /etc/login.defs and does not override the chosen method anymore\nchanges in the filesystem (>= 2023.09.18) and pambase (>= 20230918) packages ensure, that umask is set centrally in /etc/login.defs instead of /etc/profile\n[1] https://www.openwall.com/yescrypt/\n[2] https://man.archlinux.org/man/umask.1p\n[3] https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PAM\n[4] https://www.password-hashing.net/\n[5] https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt/pull/113\n[6] https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt/pull/150\n[7] https://github.com/linux-pam/linux-pam/issues/607\n[8] https://man.archlinux.org/man/pam_unix.8",

I’ve been using Fastmail exclusively since then and have only good things to say about it. The user interface is rock-solid and fast, and there have been very few times that they’ve had a server outage. But it’s just been qualitatively better than Gmail, not differentiated by a feature.\nMasked email\nThat’s changed: I think that Fastmail’s “Masked Email” is a good reason for the Gmail-faithful to switch. It’s both a fantastic way to manage spam sources and a real win for privacy.\nMasked email works best when you also use 1Password. You can then link your 1Password and Fastmail accounts, and whenever you see a signup form on the web, not only wil…",

Instead of manually configuring the database each time you deploy your application, you can use an Init Container to handle this task. The Init Container can run scripts to create tables, seed initial data, or set up the database schema. Once the database is ready, the main application container can safely start, knowing that the required database structure is in place.\n \nThe below example defines an init container which runs under the same pod as main app container, seeds data to an existing Azure MySQL Database which will be used by the main web app container to serve contents onto the landing page.\n \n\n \nThe init container inserts a record into an existing table named myguests in Azure My SQL DB using a python script. The script contains code for connecting to the Database alongside inserting record into the Database. This data will then be retrieved and used by the main app container which is also running a python Flask based web application and return the value in the landing page.\n \nDockerfile for Init Container\n \n \n \nFROM python\nCOPY . .\nRUN pip install mysql && pip install mysql-connector-python\nCMD [\"python\", \"test.py\"]\n\n \n \n \n \nPython Script for Init Container\n \n \n \nimport mysql.connector\n\nmydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n  host=\"init-test.mysql.database.azure.com\",\n  user=\"*******\",\n  password=\"*******\",\n  database=\"*****\"\n)\n\nmycursor = mydb.cursor()\n\nsql = \"INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'test@outlook.com')\"\n\nmycursor.execute(sql)\n\nmydb.commit()\n\nprint(mycursor.rowcount, \"record(s) affected\")\n\n \n \n \n \nOutput from Init Container\n \n\n \n \n \nDockerfile for main app container\n \n \n \nFROM python\nCOPY . .\nRUN pip install mysql-connector && pip install flask\nEXPOSE 5000\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n \n \n \nOutput",

          "description": "Ensuring that your applications perform seamlessly under load is crucial. The last thing you want is for a code change or new feature to negatively impact your app's performance. That's where load testing swoops in to save the day. But what if we told you there's an even cooler way to handle load testing? Yep, you guessed it – automating it with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Azure Pipelines and Azure Load Testing.\n \nWhy automate load tests with CI/CD?\nBefore we jump into the nitty-gritty, let's understand why automating load tests with CI/CD is a game-changer:\n\nDetect issues early: By integrating load tests into your CI/CD pipeline, you can detect performance issues early .

          "description": "In some scenarios, you might need to preprocess files before they're used by your application. For instance, you're deploying a machine learning model that relies on precomputed data files. An Init Container can download, extract, or preprocess these files, ensuring they are ready for the main application container. This approach simplifies the deployment process and ensures that your application always has access to the required data.\n \nThe below example defines a simple Pod that has an init container which downloads a file from some resource to a file share which is shared between the init and main app container. The main app container is running a php-apache image and serves the landing page using the index.php file downloaded into the shared file space.\n \n\n \nThe init container mounts the shared volume at /mydir , and the main application container mounts the shared volume at /var/www/html. The init container runs the following command to download the file and then terminates: wget -O /mydir/index.php http://info.cern.ch. \n \nConfigurations and dockerfile for init container:\n \n\nMount the storage file share on the environment level\nCreate init container with mounting file share named init on path /mydir:\n\n\n \n \n\nDockerfile for init which downloads an index.php file under /mydir:\n\n \nFROM busybox:1.28 \nWORKDIR / \nENTRYPOINT [\"wget\", \"-O\", \"/mydir/index.php\", \"http://info.cern.ch\"]\n \n \n \nConfiguration for main app container:\n \n\nCreate main app container mounting file share named init on path /var/www/html:\n\n\n \n \n\nMain app container configuration which uses php-apache image and serves the index.php file from DocumentRoot /var/www/html:\n\n\n \nOutput:\n \n\n \n \n \nLogs:",

          "description": "A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.\n \n1. Install the plugin\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -> Settings -> Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.\n\n \n2. Leverage the plugin\nOpen the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.\n\nYou will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.\n\n \n3. Resolve conflict\nTo resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.\nAfter resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.\n\n \n4. Conclusion\nDependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.\nReferences:Troubleshoot dependency version conflicts when using the Azure SDK for Java | Microsoft Learn Maven – Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism (apache.org)",
