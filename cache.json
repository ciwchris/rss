          "description": "We are introducing a change in JDK/JRE packages of our distro. This is\ntriggered from the way a JRE is build in modern versions of Java (>9). We are\nintroducing this change in Java 21.\nTo sum it up instead of having JDK and JRE packages coexist in the same system\nwe will be making them conflict. The JDK variant package includes the runtime\nenvironment to execute Java applications so if one needs compilation and\nruntime of Java they need only the JDK package in the future. If, on the other\nhand, they need just runtime of Java then JRE (or jre-headless) will work.\nThis will (potentially) require a manual user action during upgrade:\nIf you have both JDK and JRE installed you can manually install the JDK\nwith pacman -Syu jdk-openjdk and this removes the JRE related packages.\nIf you have both JRE and JRE-headless you will need to choose one of\nthem and install it manually since they would conflict each other now.\nIf you only have one of the JDK/JRE/JRE-headless pacman should resolve\ndependencies normally and no action is needed.\nAt the moment this is only valid for the upcoming JDK 21 release.",

At the latter, there were multiple mosh pits and the most packed audience I’ve ever encountered. It was my first ‘metal’ oriented concert, and the friendliness and openness of everyone who attended was remarkable.\n\n\nVia Arts Gowanus, I saw lots of local art and was especially struck by Perrin Ireland’s art about animals, gender, and climate change.\nBooks\nI read five great books in a row but broke the streak by reading Charles Eisenstein.

The 2022 CNCF Annual Survey touts Kubernetes as “the ‘operating system’ of the cloud,” as it has become the platform for running almost any kind of workload. Cost optimization, however, continues to be a top challenge for organizations regardless of their level of maturity and experience adopting Kubernetes.\n \nOrganizations are looking for ways to reduce cloud spend, but without cost visibility and allocation tooling it is difficult to know where to start and what to optimize.
