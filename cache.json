Note that the bugtracker is still flyspray and that merge requests are not accepted as of now. \nWe intend to open the issue tracker and merge requests on the Gitlab package repos in the near future.\nMirrors are syncing again, but it may take a bit of time until your mirror of choice has caught up.\nFor users\nUpdate your system and merge the pacman pacnew /etc/pacman.conf.pacnew file. This is required as we have moved the [community] repository into [extra].\n$ pacman -Syu \"pacman>=6.0.2-7\"\n\nFor users of the now deprecated asp tool, you will need to switch to pkgctl:\n$ pacman -Syu \"devtools>=1:1.0.0-1\"\n$ pkgctl repo clone linux\n\nFor some more detailed instructions on how to obtain PKGBUILDs see the corresponding wiki article.\nFor packagers\nBefore starting, first uninstall devtools-git-poc and remove any repos from your filesystem that you cloned during the git proof-of-concept testing.\nMake sure you have both, an updated devtools and pacman on your system:\n$ pacman -Syu \"devtools>=1:1.0.0-1\" \"pacman>=6.0.2-7\"\n\nAdditionally clean up old chroots in /var/lib/archbuild/\n$ rm -rf /var/lib/archbuild/\n# or optionally, use the --clean option for pkgctl build *ONCE*\n$ pkgctl build --clean\n\nFor instruction on how to use pkgctl, please take a look at the \"How to be a packager\" wiki article and also consult the man page of each subcommand for further information:\n$ man pkgctl-build\n$ man pkgctl-repo-clone",

          "description": "This Friday morning (2023-05-19) the Git packaging migration will start until Sunday (2023-05-21). The Arch Linux packaging team will not be able to update packages in any of the repositories during this period.\nNotification when the migration starts, and when it is completed, will be published on the [arch-dev-public] mailing list.\nHow does this impact Arch Linux users?\nThe [testing] repository will be split into [core-testing] and [extra-testing], the [staging] repository will be split into [core-staging] and [extra-staging]. The [community] repository will be merged into [extra] and will therefore be empty after the migration.\nAll affected repositories will be provided as empty repositories for a transition period after the migration. For regular users, this means that everything works as before.\nNote: After the migration is done, users that have the testing repositories enabled need to include the new repositories ([core-testing] and [extra-testing] instead of [testing]) in their pacman.conf before updating their system.\nOther changes:\nSVN access is discontinued and will dissappear.\nThe svn2git mirror will no longer be updated.\nasp, which relies on the svn2git mirror, will stop working. It is replaced by pkgctl repo clone.\nHow does this impact Arch Linux tier 1 mirrors?\nDuring the migration rsync and HTTP access will be shut down. We will send an email notification to arch-mirrors once everything has been finished.\nHow does this impact Arch Linux packagers?\nPackagers will not be able to patch and update their packages. The internal Tier 0 mirror is also going to be disabled for the duration of this migration.",

          "description": "Testing application changes rapidly is often a catalyst to delivering on business requirements quickly. That’s why we so often spend so much effort to optimize the time between “File Save” and “Browser Reload”. A lot of time this loop happens entirely on our workstations, and we forgo the true end-to-end test of reviewing our changes on the platform that will later run the application -- doing so usually takes too long.\n \nThis gap between developing and running an application is often also the reason we rarely keep our applications up to date. Once an app is running and we’ve moved on to the next project, it’s often too tedious to come back. We need to switch context, reopen an old project we barely remember, just to check if there’s been an update to any of the components we’ve used. If t…",
