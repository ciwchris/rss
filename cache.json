This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won't know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.\n \nIn this post, we'll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We'll create a simple API that implements the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job.

It's a recommended practice in any case, but it's a critical consideration for your APIs since your consumers will depend on consistent performance for their client applications.\n \nIncorporating benchmark testing of your Microsoft Azure API Management services into your software delivery process provides several important benefits:\n \n\nIt establishes performance baseline as a known, quantifiable starting point against which future results can be compared.\nIt identifies performance regressions so that you can pinpoint changes or integrations that may be causing performance degradation or hindering scalability — in effect helping you to identify whi…",
