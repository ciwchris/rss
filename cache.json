Cutting through the tech jargon, observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.\n \nYou might wonder, isn’t that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there’s a glitch slowing things down (that’s the “What”). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the “Why”).\n \nLet’s say an app is responding slowly.
